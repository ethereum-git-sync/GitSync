This is the suggested template for new EIPs. Note that an EIP number will be assigned by an editor. When opening a pull request to submit your EIP, please use an abbreviated title in the filename, `eip-draft_title_abbrev.md`. The title should be 44 characters or less.-->\r\n## Simple Summary\r\n<!--\"If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough.\" Provide a simplified and layman-accessible explanation of the EIP.-->\r\nAn extension of the ERC721 standard that provides batch transfer functions.\r\n\r\n## Abstract\r\n<!--A short (~200 word) description of the technical issue being addressed.-->\r\nAdds batch transfer functions for ERC721 non-fungible tokens.\r\n## Motivation\r\n<!--The motivation is critical for EIPs that want to change the Ethereum protocol. It should clearly explain why the existing protocol specification is inadequate to address the problem that the EIP solves. EIP submissions without sufficient motivation may be rejected outright.-->\r\nTransferring multiple ERC721 tokens requires multiple transactions, which is inconvenient and uses more gas than necessary.\r\n\r\nThis standard solves this without replacing the ERC721 standard.\r\n\r\nIn some cases the gas savings that is possible with batch transfers is huge.\r\n\r\n## Specification\r\n<!--The technical specification should describe the syntax and semantics of any new feature. The specification should be detailed enough to allow competing, interoperable implementations for any of the current Ethereum platforms (go-ethereum, parity, cpp-ethereum, ethereumj, ethereumjs, and [others](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/Clients)).-->\r\n\r\n```solidity\r\npragma solidity ^0.4.24;\r\n\r\n/// @title ERC1412 Batch Transfers For Non-Fungible Tokens\r\n///  Note: the ERC-165 identifier for this interface is 0x2b89bcaa\r\ninterface ERC1412 {\r\n  /// @notice Transfers the ownership of multiple NFTs from one address to another address\r\n  /// @param _from The current owner of the NFT\r\n  /// @param _to The new owner\r\n  /// @param _tokenIds The NFTs to transfer\r\n  /// @param _data Additional data with no specified format, sent in call to `_to`  \r\n  function safeBatchTransferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256[] _tokenIds, bytes _data) external payable;\r\n  \r\n  /// @notice Transfers the ownership of multiple NFTs from one address to another address\r\n  /// @param _from The current owner of the NFT\r\n  /// @param _to The new owner\r\n  /// @param _tokenIds The NFTs to transfer  \r\n  function safeBatchTransferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256[] _tokenIds) external payable; \r\n```\r\n`safeBatchTransferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256[] _tokenIds, bytes _data)` must implement the same functionality as `safeTransferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 _tokenId, bytes data)` from the ERC721 standard but for multiple NFTs.\r\n\r\n`safeBatchTransferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256[] _tokenIds)` must implement the same functionality as `safeTransferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 _tokenId)` from the ERC721 standard but for multiple NFTs.\r\n\r\n## Rationale\r\n<!--The rationale fleshes out the specification by describing what motivated the design and why particular design decisions were made. It should describe alternate designs that were considered and related work, e.g. how the feature is supported in other languages. The rationale may also provide evidence of consensus within the community, and should discuss important objections or concerns raised during discussion.-->\r\nThis standard solves the problem of needing or wanting batch transfers without replacing the ERC721 standard which is widely adopted.\r\n\r\nYou will notice that there is no `batchApprove` function in this standard. The reason is because ERC721 already provides the `setApprovalForAll` function which is a form of batch approve and suffices.\r\n\r\nA non-safe/unsafe batch transfer function is not needed.\r\n\r\n## Backwards Compatibility\r\nThis standard is compatible with the ERC721 standard.\r\n\r\nImplementing this standard does not prevent third-party contracts from making batch transfers.\r\n\r\n## Copyright\r\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).",

    "body": "@AusIV Thank you for taking a look at this standard and considering it.\r\n\r\nIt does not need to be a part of the token contract itself. Contract programmers are free to implement this standard or not. Implementing this standard does not prevent third-party contracts from doing batch transfers. Someone could implement this standard and still have third-party contracts do batch transfers. \r\n\r\nImplementing batch transfers in the token contract just solves certain problems and makes some things easier/better and saves gas.\r\n\r\nI do not claim that this standard is appropriate for all NFT contracts, just that I think it is appropriate for enough to be useful.\r\n\r\nIf you don't want batch transfer functions complicating your NFT contract then they will complicate your third-party contract or wherever they end up. I don't know what complication you are thinking about. The complication depends on your contract and contract design. For some contracts and contract designs the complexity of adding 2 batch transfer functions is minimal and not an issue.\r\n\r\nHere are problems solved by having batch transfers in the token contract:\r\n1. Third-party contracts that do batch transfers may not be known or easy to find because they aren't in the token contract. And third-party contracts that do batch transfers might be specific to some application and so may not be usable generally.\r\n2. Users who do not have a third-party contract are forced to make one, or find one, or transfer their tokens one by one which is horrible if they have a lot.\r\n\r\nHere are things that are made better:\r\n1. A third-party contract requires a transaction that calls the `setApprovalForAll` before it can execute another transaction that does the batch transfer. If the batch transfer functions are in the NFT contract then users can call them directly without having to have a `setApprovalForAll` transaction. This reduces the number of transactions from 2 to 1. This isn't a big deal but is better.\r\n2. If the batch transfer functions are in the token contract then users only need to trust 1 contract when making a batch transfer. If a third-party contract is doing the transfer then the users have to trust 2 contracts. This is not a big deal either but it is better to trust less contracts.\r\n\r\nGas savings of batch transfer functions implemented in an NFT contract:\r\n1. Calling the `function transferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 _tokenId)` function in a third-party contract that does batch transfers costs about 2000 gas. You are right, if you aren't transferring many tokens and not often then the gas savings is minimal.  But if you are transferring a ton of tokens or doing batch transfers frequently then the gas savings will be more.\r\n\r\n\r\n",

    "body": "@MoMannn - If _to becomes an array, you're paying and additional 1360 gas per transferred item to designate its recipient (68 gas per byte of input data, times 20 bytes per address). That's fine if you want to send to a bunch of different recipients, but eats away at about 70% of the gas savings of this EIP if you want to send a bunch of items to the same recipient.\r\n\r\nThis brings me back to my point about just delegating batch transfers to another contract. What people want to get out of batch transfers isn't going to be consistent, and there are going to be tradeoffs of each approach. Trying to bake all of those possibilities into the token contract is going to create a lot of complexity and room for error, just to save a bit of gas on something that could already be handled pretty efficiently through purpose built contracts.\r\n\r\nIf the argument is that those contracts don't exist, go build them.

The reason is because ERC721 already provides the `setApprovalForAll` function which is a form of batch approve and suffices.\r\n> \r\n> A non-safe/unsafe batch transfer function is not needed.\r\n> ## Backwards Compatibility\r\n> \r\n> This standard is compatible with the ERC721 standard.\r\n> \r\n> Implementing this standard does not prevent third-party contracts from making batch transfers.\r\n> ## Copyright\r\n> \r\n> Copyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).\r\n\r\nYou know without actually seeing this EIP, I recreated it.
