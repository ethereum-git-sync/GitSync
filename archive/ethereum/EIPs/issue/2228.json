  "body": "LIVE VERSION: https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2228\r\n\r\n*Draft text follows*\r\n\r\n```yaml\r\neip: 2228\r\ntitle: Canonicalize the name of network ID 1 and chain ID 1\r\nauthor: William Entriken (@fulldecent)\r\ndiscussions-to: https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/2228\r\nstatus: Review\r\ntype: Informational\r\ncreated: 2019-08-04\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Simple Summary\r\n\r\nThe Ethereum network with network ID 1 and chain ID 1 is named Ethereum Mainnet.\r\n\r\n## Abstract\r\n\r\nThe name for the Ethereum network with network ID 1 and chain ID 1 shall be Ethereum Mainnet or just Mainnet. This is a proper noun.\r\n\r\nThis standard specifies the name for this network and provides reference examples in an effort to standardize the word choice and provide a common language for use to refer to this network.\r\n\r\n## Motivation\r\n\r\nThe Ethereum network with network ID 1 and chain ID 1 is referenced using several conflicting names across EIPs, client implementations, and information published on the internet at large. In several locations, even documents written by the same author use inconsistent names to refer to the Ethereum network with network ID 1 and chain ID 1. Names in use at the time of this writing include:\r\n\r\n* \"main net\"\r\n* \"mainnet\"\r\n* \"Main net\"\r\n* \"Mainnet\"\r\n\r\n## Specification\r\n\r\nThe network name for network ID 1 and chain ID 1 shall be Ethereum Mainnet, or just Mainnet if the context is known to be discussing Ethereum networks. This IS a proper noun. Several examples are given below which differentiate between usage of the name of the network versus a descriptive reference to the network.\r\n\r\nAny name or word styling (i.e. capitalization of the letters) of the network which is inconsistent with the test cases cited below shall NOT be used.\r\n\r\n### Trademark note\r\n\r\n\"Ethereum\" is trademarked by the Ethereum Foundation. For more information on your obligations when mentioning \"Ethereum\", and possibly \"Ethereum Mainnet\", see:\r\n\r\n* USPTO registration number 5110579 by Ethereum Foundation\r\n* The note \"you must not use [this mark] without the prior written permission of the Foundation\" on the Ethereum Foundation website, Terms of Use page\r\n\r\n## Rationale\r\n\r\nChoosing common word use promotes interoperability of implementations and increases customer awareness. Also, it adds a sense of professionalism when customers see the same word and word styling (i.e. capitalization of letters) across different implementations.\r\n\r\nAnybody that has travelled to certain countries and seen an \"IPhone [sic]\" repair store should immediately recognize that this is off-brand and unofficial. Likewise, the astute customer of Ethereum should recognize if they see the network referred to using inconsistent names in different software, so let's avoid this.\r\n\r\n## Backwards Compatibility\r\n\r\n- MetaMask previously used \"Main Ethereum Network\" in the account network chooser. MetaMask has been updated consistent with this EIP.\r\n\r\n- References to Mainnet that are inconsistent with this specification are made in: [EIP-2](./eip-2.md), [EIP-779](./eip-779.md), [EIP-150](./eip-150.md), [EIP-155](./eip-155.md), [EIP-161](./eip-161.md), [EIP-170](./eip-170.md), [EIP-190](./eip-190.md), [EIP-225](./eip-225.md), [EIP-1013](./eip-1013.md), [EIP-1679](./eip-1679.md), [EIP-1716](./eip-1716.md), [EIP-2028](./eip-2028.md), [EIP-2200](./eip-2200.md), and [EIP-2387](./eip-2387.md). For consistency, we recommend the editor will update EIPs to consistently use the name as specified in this EIP.\r\n\r\n## Test Cases\r\n\r\n### Examples referencing the name of the network ✅\r\n\r\n> The contract was deployed to Ethereum Mainnet.\r\n\r\n> Ethereum runs many applications, this Dapp was deployed to Mainnet.\r\n\r\nNo specification is made on whether Dapp, dapp, dApp, etc. is preferred.\r\n\r\n> SWITCH TO MAINNET\r\n\r\nThis example shows a user interface which is in uppercase. To be semantically correct, this could be written in HTML as `<span style=\"text-transform: uppercase\">Switch to Mainnet</span>`.\r\n\r\n> switch to mainnet\r\n\r\nThis example shows a user interface which is in lowercase. To be semantically correct, this could be written in HTML as `<span style=\"text-transform: lowercase\">Switch to Mainnet</span>`.\r\n\r\n### Examples referencing the network in a descriptive way ✅\r\n\r\n> Mainnet has ### times the number of transactions as the test networks.\r\n\r\n### Examples of other correct word usage ✅\r\n\r\n> The main network on Ethereum is Mainnet\r\n\r\nThis shows that \"main\" is used as a descriptive word, but Mainnet is the specific network which is having network ID 1 and chain ID 1.\r\n\r\n### Examples of poor word choice (avoid this) ❌\r\n\r\n> Deploy your contract to the Ethereum main network.\r\n\r\nThis is referring to a \"main\" network which is context-dependent. If you were reading this text on a page about Ethereum Classic, they would be referring to network ID 2 and chain ID 62. Therefore this word usage is less crisp. Do NOT use wording like this.\r\n\r\n> Connect to mainnet.\r\n\r\nThese words literally mean nothing. The lowercase, not-proper-noun word \"mainnet\" is not a plain English word and it should not be in any dictionary. Do NOT use wording like this.\r\n\r\n## Copyright\r\n\r\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).",

    "body": "@timbeiko \r\n\r\nFirst, as to the prescription. Yes, you make a good point, \"it may be necessary for your application to...\" was inappropriately over-prescriptive. That is now replaced to the more generic \"For more information on your obligations...\".\r\n\r\nFixed at 9dd16b8d2750e676b0449ed0f9e49f7e5b9d0ff1.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nNext is the question of how [the authoritative statement](https://ethereum.org/en/terms-of-use/#trademarks):\r\n\r\n> TRADEMARKS\r\n>\r\n> The Foundation name... and all related names... are trademarks of the Foundation or its affiliates or licensors. You must not use such marks without the prior written permission of the Foundation.... All other names, logos, product and service names, designs and slogans on this Websites are the trademarks of their respective owners.\r\n\r\nis referring to the \"Ethereum\" registered trademark.\r\n\r\nThis is the TRADEMARKS section of the website terms and it does clearly bifurcate all trademarks as either:\r\n\r\n1. being \"trademarks of the foundation\"; or\r\n2. being \"trademarks of their respective owners\".\r\n\r\nOf course the Ethereum trademark is used all over on the Ethereum.org website, and of course it is a \"trademark of the foundation\" rather than some other \"respective owner\". So therefore the Ethereum trademark must be in-scope for the statement \"You must not use such marks without the prior written permission of the Foundation.\"\r\n\r\nBecause the Foundation website is authoritative, and because a reasonable reading of the Foundation policy appears to place a normative restriction on the use of the word \"Ethereum\", and because this EIP recommends to use the word \"Ethereum Mainnet\" specifically in applications, now therefore it is appropriate at least to reference this normative statement in the text.\r\n\r\nThe SPECIFICATION section is where it is recommended \"The network name... shall be Ethereum Mainnet\", so this is where it is appropriate for the TRADEMARK NOTE section to follow. (TRADEMARK NOTE is a subsection under SPECIFICATION.)\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nSo yes, I agree with you that this EIP should not over-prescribe. That is now fixed. I hope you will agree that the note of relevant information should remain included.",

    "body": "> IMO this is not very slippery because we have standardized how \"Mainnet\" should be referred to and we should now rectify the wording in EIPs the misuse it. I think this should be a new consideration when editing, the same way EIP1234 is not an acceptable way of referring to an EIP.\r\n\r\nThere exists a standard for \"Mainnet\" but there is no consensus that the standard **SHOULD** be used.  Anyone can create a standard as long as they follow the rules for doing so, but adoption is completely out of scope of this repository and the editors.\r\n\r\nI feel like there is a significant step between standardize formatting of links and references within this repository (something that can benefit automation and tooling) and standardizing on word choice.  I generally like this particular standard, but I am pretty loath to get into the game of word selection standardization by committee. ",
