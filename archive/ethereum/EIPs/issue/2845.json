    "body": "Replying to @kdenhartog from the duplicate discussion thread #2851 \r\n\r\n**Original message:**\r\n> My first round of feedback for this:\r\n>\r\n> One of the general topics that's been discussed quite a bit is if we want to restrict the algorithms and key types supported in the JOSE registries. Often times this is done to limit the scope of code that needs to be written by various implementations which in turn should bolster interoperability. I see you've done this via recommendations, but I'd wonder if we want to restrict further usage here via explicitly not supporting certain algorithms. Is that something you think would be beneficial?\r\n>\r\n> Note: This next piece of feedback is based on potentially misunderstanding the paths permission aspect. I'd like to figure out more about this and then we may not need to address the comments below. Additionally, I'd like to understand the architecture of where the operations are being performed because I'm thinking I misunder\r\n>\r\n> Another point that I caught quite quickly is that this EIP is looking to use DIDs to manage discoverability of keys. I'm happy to see this approach being taken further as I think it will help quite a bit. I hope it's an approach that more DApps look to use as well. With that in mind, one of the things that I wasn't sure about was how the API would be integrated with key management to perform the sign and encrypt operations. Is your current assumption that a Key Management architecture will be used within the implementation and it's the responsibility of implementers to be handle this? In general, every JOSE implementation I've looked at has made the assumption that the private key is provided in some way and it will perform the cryptographic operation when necessary. This is slightly different from what's proposed at this point though. I think we may need to think more about what the general expectation is on the implementers and the callers in terms of who's providing which data (private key), who's performing the cryptographic operations, and who's performing the structuring of the data (e.g. creating the JWE with the signed data). From there we'll likely want to take a look at the general API design to make sure it aligns with what's generally done by wallets and other DApps that would be using this API.\r\n>\r\n> I'm also interested to know more about why encrypt and verify were not included. I assume there's back history from the previous attempts that may further explain this. Have they already been added via other APIs or was there some other reason that they were left off?\r\n>\r\n> In general though @oed, I like the direction that you're going with this and I'm curious to hear others opinions on this.\r\n\r\nPersonally I would be fine with restricting the alg and key types to the ones that are supported by JOSE registries (are those used by default for COSE as well?). \r\n\r\nSo the JSON-RPC is used for two main things with ethereum. Interacting interacting with chain state, and requesting things from the wallet. This means that it acts as a way for an app to request signatures and account information from a wallet. So in our case here the only things needed to be done wallet side is *signing* and *decrypting*. Internally wallets are free to use whichever key management system they prefer. A caller of any of these methods won't need to provide any type of key material.\r\nBoth verifying and encryption can happen completely client side (without any wallet interaction) so there is no need to add methods for them. Instead a utility library that does this can be implemented (we're thinking about implementing these utility functions in the **js-did** library).",

I should probably explicitly say `ES256K` 👍 \r\n\r\n> IMO, making the header a required RPC argument, and restricting the valid values of alg is a good way of addressing this issue.\r\n\r\nHm, seems like this would require the application developer to be aware of which algs the wallet supports. This would mean that there needs to be an additional rpc method for getting this information. I'd rather have the wallet decide this and append the alg that it is using.\r\n\r\n> There is also detached JWS https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7797\r\n\r\nHappy to add this if others express interest.\r\n\r\n> I'm not sure adding the did_* prefix to RPC calls is wise.... especially if what we are really doing is exposing JOSE / COSE interfaces....

Essentially by setting the `kid` to the DID (and key fragment) for the signing entity. Imo this is critical for this EIP to be successful. Using `did_*` for decryption also simplifies things because the combination of key discovery and decryption is key for dev UX.",

    "body": "> what RPC interfaces will be provided for getting public key bytes\r\n\r\nThis is what `did_authenticate` is for. With it you will get back the DID that was authenticated. To get the public key bytes you can use something like the [DID Resolver](https://github.com/decentralized-identity/did-resolver) which works with any DID method (provided a resolver is implemented for it).\r\n\r\nThe problem with an RPC method like `did_resolve` is that it's not really the responsibility of a wallet to resolve DIDs for apps. Instead Ethereum clients would need to implement this method, but then there has to be consensus among client implementers which DID methods to support (would be very hard). I also think DID resolution is more of an application on top of blockchains rather than something that should be implemented in blockchain client software.",

Might make sense to make this an actual JWT/CWT with an expiry actually. A `challenge` should definitely be included.\r\n\r\n`nonce` has that purpose in id_token JWTs in OIDC (see IANA claims registry). If you introduce a new claim for this purpose, then registering a new claim name in the IANA should be considered.\r\n\r\n> What is your thinking on `aud` @awoie? Is it strictly needed?\r\n\r\n`aud` can be optional and it can be any arbitrary stringOrUri. I think it would be good practice to make use of that. Everyone that receives the JWS would have to identify itself and then decide whether to reject the JWS. Not sure what is the CWS equivalent.\r\n\r\n> > That certainly only makes sense using authcrypt -> e.g., ECDH-1PU\r\n> \r\n> Would you mind expanding on this? And yeah for the suggested encryption alg you can just do the encryption client side.\r\n\r\n[ECDH-1PU](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-madden-jose-ecdh-1pu-00) is for example used in [DIDComm-messaging](https://identity.foundation/didcomm-messaging/docs/spec/) to encrypt a message to a DID while enabling the receiver of the encrypted message to verify some sort of authenticity that the sender is has a certain DID (or more general keys) by avoiding the sign-JWS-then-encrypt-JWE pattern. In that case, only the wallet would be able to create such a JWE/CWE because only the wallet controls the private key. \r\n\r\n> > Is the did parameter needed if the kid or something similar could be used to determine the DID in the CWE/JWE?\r\n> \r\n> The `kid` should **not** specified in the JWE/CWE. That would leak information about the ciphertext.\r\n\r\nThe `kid` won't be in the Ciphertext of the JWE. It would be in the unprotected header field per recipient: see https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7516#section-4.1.6. You could use the same pattern as you described for JWS/CWS and use a DID URL.",

    "body": "Thanks for creating this proposal.\r\n\r\nRegarding `did_authenticate`. From the discussion, It looks like it has multiple purpose\r\n\r\nThe current draft of this proposal specify that `did_authenticate` requires user permission. This seems important if authentication is used for something other than ensuring that the user indeed control the did (the private key of the ethereum address presented).\r\n\r\nOtherwise, as @pedrouid mentions, `did_authenticate` could simply replace `eth_requestAccounts`, see in particular: https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/eip-1102-opt-in-provider-access/414/58 which would already require user to accept showing their did.\r\n\r\nBut looking at the current draft of the proposal here, it seems that `did_authenticate` performs more than simply checking if the user control the did being advertised. \r\n\r\nIt accept a `path` parameter. And then further in the proposal it is mentioned that decryption happen without user confirmation only if `did_authenticate` was already accepted for a particular path.\r\n\r\nIf we go with the idea that `did_authenticate` replace `eth_requestAccount`, the `path` should default to the application origin (like in `eth_requestAccount`) then the only prompt should be about accepting to reveal your did, the authentication is then done automatically so the application can be sure the user is indeed in control of that did and is not someone faking it.\r\n\r\nAny other `path` would require user confirmation.\r\n\r\nFurthermore as mentioned [here](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/130#issuecomment-329770999) and explained in [Proposal 1: Non-Interactive Decryption](https://medium.com/@wighawag/3-proposals-for-making-web3-a-better-experience-974f97765700)\r\nIf we consider the default path being the application origin,\r\nThen decryption should happen automatically for every encryption performed from that same origin. No user confirmation should be required there. For that a mechanism should be put in place so that encryption include the `origin` in the data.\r\n\r\n![diagram](https://miro.medium.com/max/1575/1*viioAefmbO9gpdUqE8-WlQ.png)\r\n\r\nThis would allow a seamless encrypted storage for application, that can then be safely shared across devices.\r\nOf course this is only fully under user control for application on content-addressable system like ipfs, but as mentioned in my comment and blog, an ENS or even DNS name that point to an ipfs hash should use the ipfs hash as the origin (not the ENS name).\r\n\r\nNow if the content change (and so the uri), the user would be requested to `did_authenticate` the new \"path\"\r\n\r\nNow, I am not very knowledgeable with JWS and I might abuse term \"path\" here by allowing it to represent URI. If that is the case, we could separate the 2.\r\n\r\n\r\nNote: for traditional URI (non content-addressable) it could be up to the wallet to decide whether a user confirmation is required as there is a security risk that the application get compromised.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

    "body": "@wighawag While we could use `path` like that I would strongly advise against it since it would incentivize apps to silo data around their origins. Where as if you just use a path unrelated to origin this would make it easier to share data across apps. \r\n\r\nI'm saying this mainly because I believe data should always be independent of the app that is bee used to display the data.

And for case where getting a unique identifier is not possible, the permission request would show up. We should not sacrifice one use case because it is not possible in all scenario.\r\n\r\nI should precise though that this not for all use case. You would obviously not use an ipfs hash as path for data that you expect to be globally shared like name, profile picture, etc\r\n\r\nThis is mostly for specific data that would be a pain to request authentication for.\r\n\r\nBut maybe, a better alternative is to request authentication at the time of encryption (even if is is technically unnecessary) so a user is not surprised to have to accept an application after already interacting with it.\r\n\r\nBut I guess the application could simple call `did_authenticate` before hand and there would be no issue. \r\n\r\nMy aim is to remove all unnecessary confirmation, as this is a real pain from the user perspective.\r\n",
