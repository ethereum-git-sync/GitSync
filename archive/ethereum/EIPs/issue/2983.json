    "body": "hi, i've been working on similar things in and around europe recently so i'm glad to see the potential for some kind of standard\r\n\r\nmost of the logic around whitelist vs. frozen i believe i can incorporate fairly easily as it is very similar to what i have already done\r\n\r\ni do have some feedback:\r\n\r\n1.\r\n\r\nhaving a single \"issuer\" role seems unnecessarily broad and centralizing in nature, although i appreciate that the singular issuer address could be handed to a smart contract that implements its own fine grained access control.\r\n\r\nwould it make sense to separate the ability to manage the white/frozen lists from the ability to directly handle funds?\r\n\r\nsimilarly, a whitelist may be a simple process of KYC review before a distribution, whereas a frozenlist is somewhat more extreme as it implies some kind of serious wrongdoing on behalf of the frozen account. I'd expect potentially different people/departments handling basic onboarding vs. chasing something like sanctions. Could managing the two lists be two different roles?\r\n\r\nin this scenario i would expect that ONLY funds on the frozenlist can be revoked/reassigned, which could hamper an attacker as they would need to compromise BOTH a freezer and a revoker account in order to arbitrarily move funds to themselves.\r\n\r\nin this scenario i would also expect that funds that were delisted from the whitelist but still held are NOT able to be revoked/reassigned. To me this intuitively seems more true to the stated intention of having frozen and whitelisted funds as separate concepts, where the latter still allows assets to be owned by the holding address until they dispose of them.\r\n\r\n\r\n2.\r\n\r\n\r\ni also see the monolithic \"issuer\" role as a potential misnomer as nowhere in the spec (if i read correctly) is it required that the \"issuer\" issues (mints and/or distributes) anything. The only privileges that an \"issuer\" has are the rights to _remove_ access to assets.\r\n\r\n3.\r\n\r\nlastly i am concerned that the methods that _write_ to the whitelist and frozenlist are specified at the interface level.\r\n\r\nfor example, i have implemented contracts that are compatible with the concept of being a white/frozen list externally to the token itself, which allows for:\r\n\r\n- combining several lists AND/OR style into a single list to support e.g. multiple parallel KYC backends each with their own admins\r\n- additional bytes of data to be submitted alongside adding/banning/removing users from the list that are emitted in event logs for offchain audit history\r\n- several layers of access control around admins/executors of various KYC style operations beyond a single add/remove function (e.g. i distinguish between being a known-bad agent flagged as \"banned\" onchain and being completely removed from contract storage)\r\n- batch modifications which can be important for gas efficiency given the potential for very large lists (thousands or tens of thousands) to be managed, perhaps the main list is managed offchain oracle-style and only synced periodically onchain, or even synced from another network occasionally\r\n\r\nthere's probably a lot of other things implementations might want to do with complex approval workflows that a single `address -> bool` function on the token itself can't represent efficiently\r\n\r\ngiven that the existence of some way to write to the white/frozen list is implied by the read functions in the interface, i'm personally not sure that writes need to be specified\r\n\r\nif there's a strong desire to keep and specify the write interface, then could the read and write interfaces be split with the write interface being an optional extension of the read interface?\r\n",
