A `master` branch has no connection to the `master`/`slave` terminology. I think it's more a reference to a \"master copy\" - and there is no such thing as a \"slave copy\". For this purpose, \"main copy\" works just as well.\r\n\r\nIn addition, other terminology may be far more accurate in expressing how systems work. In a system where the terms \"scheduling node\" and \"executor node\" apply, it seems a bit silly to use more ambiguous terms such as a \"master node\" and a \"slave node\" - especially when community consensus is against the usage of those terms.\r\n\r\n> Just because at some point in history someone used the terms to represent certain relationships between humans doesn't change the meaning of the terms nor degrade their usefulness in expressing relationships between things\r\n\r\nI'm afraid I have to disagree with this point about it not changing the meaning or degrading the usefulness. Look no further than the history of Pepe memes - originally having no connotation, then having a racist connotation, and now a connotation that I'm not sure anyone really knows. But the fact is, people did make racist Pepe memes and changed the meaning of Pepe memes (giving Pepe memes, including ones made before the change a slight racist connotation), and also changed the utility of them (nobody wanted to be called racist for making a Pepe meme). \r\n\r\n> Also, and this is much more abstract and philosophical, I feel like in the ethos of anti-censorship, we shouldn't try to censor speech in our repositories\r\n\r\nFirstly, does that extend to, for example, off-topic posts?

We'll see whether they are proven to be good or not. \r\n\r\nAnyways, I always welcome feedback. These kinds of changes always work best when everyone agrees, so please provide me with any refutations you can think of.",

    "body": "> I'd prefer 'current' to be defined. It's coming up on two years since Git has offered this suggestion.\r\n\r\nBy this I just mean \"the state of political correctness right now\".  There are some things that are \"currently\" politically correct and have been for decades or centuries, and there are some things that are \"currently\" PC that weren't a mere 2 years ago.  Essentially, I don't think political pressures should be what drive us to choose our terminology, and definitely shouldn't be what drives us to *change* our terminology.\r\n\r\n> Here's a proposed solution: publicize the EIPIP repo more, and have the community vote. I definitely agree with you that a four-person team of volunteer EIP editors is not sufficient.\r\n\r\nI'm pretty strongly against democracy as a solution to problems/disagreements, because it turns into tyranny of the majority (which is often disconnected from what is right/good/correct), and it is heavily subjected to human biases which leads to marketing, brigading, social signalling, etc.\r\n\r\nI tend to agree that `main` is a reasonable name for a primary git branch name.  If someone is creating a new repository and chooses that as their default branch name I have no qualms with it.  My qualms are only with *changing* a well established name of a thing for political reasons alone.  I don't think `master` causes anyone confusion, so the threshold for \"do we need to change this\" isn't met, and `main` isn't sufficiently *better* in terms of evoking the proper mental model in the reader to meet the threshold for \"concrete value addition by making a change\".\r\n\r\n> Firstly, does that extend to, for example, off-topic posts? I feel like there's a line at which it's okay to censor things if there is consensus.\r\n\r\nCuration definitely has value, but when curating I think there is significant value in limiting the curation to the most problematic stuff.  It is very easy to take curation too far, to the point where you are excluding people because you don't like the way they communicate, the words they choose, or the thoughts they have.  For me, renaming things primarily for the sake of following the latest trends in political correctness is across that line (censorship vs useful curation).",

Adopt industry wide changes where the case for the change has already been made and it is something we are able to do where the benefits outweigh the cost, such as the name change to `main`.\r\n\r\n2. If there are specific word(s) that are primarily only in Ethereum, then first a case needs to be built for a name change, such as the name change to `selfdestruct`. \r\n\r\nThe examples you gave of `git` and `commit` would fall into an industry wide change, so if they were deemed an issue would need to be led by projects such as Git/GitHub.  We could then evaluate after these projects made such a change.\r\n",

    "body": "I support renaming too. \r\n\r\nLanguage and the definition of words in certain context changes in society, it isn't uncommon. As @abcoathup mentioned, EIP-6 has proposed this sort of change before. This change of branch name is simply a change in naming convention to adopt an industry wide standard. This switch wouldn't cause any errors from what I can tell. The term `master` might be offensive to some, it certainly doesn't sit right with me (thus the commentary) due to the relationship of past Imperial rule in the country - however, personally I'm not much affected by this. Others might react differently to this situation, and it might make EIP and Ethereum less accessible to them. ",

See the work that has already been done on this.\r\n> https://lore.kernel.org/git/CAOAHyQwyXC1Z3v7BZAC+Bq6JBaM7FvBenA-1fcqeDV==apdWDg@mail.gmail.com/\r\n\r\nJust because someone claims X does not make X true.  None the less, I am willing to accept that there exists one or more people who are offended by the name.  However, as Sam illustrated, given 8 billion humans in the world you can likely find one or more people offended by just about every word in the dictionary.  Presumably, there exists some critical mass of offended people that warrants changing a long held speech pattern, and it is unclear that such a critical mass is reached.  We do not have a good credibly neutral and repeatable mechanism (like Sam discussed) to determine whether a critical mass of offended people have been reached.\r\n\r\n> Other prominent organizations have performed this rename.\r\n\r\nFollow-the-leader isn't a reasonable strategy IMO.  Other prominent organizations also build centralized services, harvest user data, spy on you, etc. (all things I think we agree Ethereum should not do)  I think any arguments in favor of this change should rest solely on the merits of the change, not because \"other people are doing it\".\r\n\r\n> The Ethereum community has previously shown that it believes words matter with the rename of an opcode to selfdestruct https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-6\r\n\r\nI wasn't around for that change, but it was in a time when the community was *far* smaller and the number of people you needed buy-in from was also much smaller.  Ethereum in that time also wasn't nearly as credibly neutral as it is now (see The DAO hardfork).  FWIW, Uncles was also renamed to Ommers around the same time I believe.\r\n\r\n",

I get a little sad inside when it comes up since it reminds me of the 400+ years of slavery and wicked oppression even up to this day. Although I fully recognise its not the intention of many, I can't help but think about it. I don't know if this original naming was intentional propaganda or pure ignorance. If the current naming doesn't offend you, it's probably because it doesn't affect you. I really wish tho the black community within the Ethereum community would have more input and say on this topic.. instead of a bunch of whites, Arabs, Latinos, and others discussing it 😁\n\nLinus, creator of git and Linux,   said before he always liked `main` from the beginning but not sure why it ended up like that; and later [banished master, blacklist, etc from Linux](https://www.theregister.com/2020/07/13/linux_adopts_inclusive_language/). This was also a [recommendation set by the Software Freedom Conservancy](https://sfconservancy.org/news/2020/jun/23/gitbranchname/) which originally prompted Git to rename. \n\nThe naming is part of a specification and specs evolve. How can Ethereum expect others to follow its specs if it has a hard time following others' specs. Ethereum is a leader and others copy its convention blindly; this change will cascade to other ecosystems that depend and lookup to Ethereum. We're not just a bunch of robots, we have social and human aspects that should be a factor in things. Plus as a bonus, `main` is shorter and actually makes more sense.",

If we conclude most arguments have been voiced by early next week we can make a decision. \r\n\r\n> Even ignoring the work required to perform it\r\n\r\nThere's definitely a large number of repositories that fall under this. Though most people in favor of this would probably prefer a change in all Ethereum repositories at once, we could also consider a gradual phase change. [Fedora project did something like this](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Changes/GitRepos-master-to-main#Scope).\r\n\r\nIt also appears that there's an [API endpoint to enable this change](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/reference/repos#update-a-repository). I would be more than happy to write a script that would apply this change globally.\r\n\r\nI appreciate how busy everyone here is and want to minimize the cost on everyone's time and energy. I also know this change would make a difference for a significant number of people and continue bringing more talent to the Ethereum space. \r\n\r\nA gradual phase out would look something like:\r\n- **Phase 1** - Policy change and major repos. All new repositories use `main`. Since the end goal of this change would be to foster community inclusivity and engagement, I think it makes sense to prioritize the most popular repositories first. Repositories included but not limited to: \r\nhttps://github.com/ethereum/EIPs\r\nhttps://github.com/ethereum/EIP-Bot\r\nhttps://github.com/ethereum/eipv\r\nhttps://github.com/ethereum-cat-herders/EIPIP/\r\nhttps://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum\r\n- **Phase 2** - All recently active repos. Something like the list from @SamWilsn, provided the autonomy of each permits.\r\n- **Phase 3** - All repositories changed to `main`. Though this has less to do with community engagement, it could make sense in order to maintain standardization. \r\n",

    "body": "> I am much more strongly against the Ethereum Foundation setting rules on language usage that are applied across all repositories in the Ethereum GitHub organization.\r\n\r\nThat's fair, you definitely have a point there. Taking that into consideration, I think this conversation should stay pertaining to EIPs.\r\n\r\nI could however see a potential benefit in official guidelines published by the Ethereum foundation, like a Code of Conduct which outlines recommended inclusive language. Then it's up to the autonomy of each repository how those guidelines are used, interpreted and enforced. [Here's an example](https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html?highlight=coding%20style#naming). I acknowledge that this is probably not the forum for that conversation, though.",
