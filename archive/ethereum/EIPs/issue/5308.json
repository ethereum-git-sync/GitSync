I don't think editor group already have or shall have the power to make such judgement.\r\n\r\nI believe the problem here is that 99% of ERCs are just contract interface definitions, and people have a tendency to not realize the amount of redundancy they are including in their title when they say \"X Smart Contract Standard\".  The entire latter portion of that sentence is almost entirely redundant and if we say nothing we can end up in a situation where every single ERC is named following that pattern or a very similar one.\r\n\r\nAs editors, we have a better overall grasp of the EIP ecosystem and recognize the redundancy where drive-by authors may not.\r\n\r\nFWIW: The text added for discouraging the word \"Standard\" in titles wasn't a hard requirement, it was just a **SHOULD NOT** so there is leeway for exceptions.  In the vast, vast, majority of cases in my experience though, the authors are just unwittingly using \"standard\" and \"smart\" redundantly.",
