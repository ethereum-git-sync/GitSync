I've not found one so far as I've briefly skimmed them and come up with some things that could be discussed in a few EIPs.\r\n\r\nStarting from the beginning. Here's just a few things I'd be thinking about to enhance the privacy of these different EIPs if I was considering implementing them. There's plenty more and I can keep going if you think it would be useful to show how this would be useful.\r\n\r\nEIP-20: Considerations around the usage of too large of a decimal value allowing too much precision which can be used to correlate transfers even when moving through a coin mixer (this is an issue with Z-Cash's shielded transactions). Considerations around linkability of transfers between users and well known addresses such as exchanges.\r\n\r\nEIP-86 (and various other account abstraction works): considerations how various types of contract logic such as multi-signatures and delegation links two persistent identifiers (e.g. Ethereum accounts)\r\n\r\nEIP-107: Fingerprinting concerns to identify the user as a web3 user.\r\n\r\nEIP-137: linking of persistent identifiers. Fingerprinting concerns. Usage of a new persistent identifier. Basically all the did-core privacy considerations apply here too: https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/#privacy-considerations\r\n\r\nEIP-162: Same considerations apply as 137\r\n\r\nEIP-173: correlating activity done as a contract owner with other on chain activity. E.g. should a personal be used when deploying the contract separate from an account used for interacting with other contracts?\r\n\r\nEIP-181: probably lots of similar considerations as 137 and 162 here.\r\n\r\nEIP-191: Displaying warnings to users about checking to make sure no PII is included in the transactions\r\n\r\nEIP-600: Considerations around the ability for people with access to a public key being able to derive child path keys and link ownership of ETH accounts\r\n\r\nEIP-601: Same as 600\r\n\r\nEIP-627: Usage of this protocol for a P2P messaging scheme to link two communicating parties by a passive malicious actor.\r\n\r\nEIP-634: Lol this one is funny because it's now encouraging storing PII on chain which has generally been regarded as a bad idea due to the immutability property\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

Would take all of an additional 30 seconds to state that though and it opens up the discussion for authors to start considering these aspects. I'd be concerned that if this is optional then I'm left fighting an up hill battle for each one where I want to advocate for privacy considerations. Also, I don't believe this should be a normative section. It's really just about calling out some privacy problems and tradeoffs that implementers should be thinking about here and trying to find ways to address.",

    "body": "Main reason I saw them as useful is to highlight how clients should be interacting with the ERCs. Assuming a user interacted with a single discrete contract the risk is quite minimal. However, this is an uncommon pattern in this space so making recommendations to wallet developers is that are interacting with these standard contracts will assist with how they go about implementing support for the contracts. Once the data is public I agree there's little that can be done. Including this section as a required option can open up a discussion that justifies a modification to an interface to reduce the amount of information that gets published.\n\nFor example of this see the recent privacy considerations section I've been working on with the author of account bound tokens in #5686\n\nIt significantly changes how users would interact with a contract to expand the definition beyond an interface to also include expected behavior such as including off chain URLs rather than the data directly on chain.",
