  "body": "Currently the gas limit is defined and paid by the caller. This proposal is about adding an option to the VM to set an alternate gas limit and gas source (the contract) by means of executing a special opcode within the contract, e.g. `PAYGAS <limit>`\n\nA simple use case: the contract decides that the caller is on the list of trusted sources (for example it is a token holder) and takes over paying the gas. Alternatively the gas limit provided by the caller is used until exhausted, before using the contract's balance. This would be especially useful at fallback entry points enabling simple transactions to interact with a contract.\n\nAs you can see this idea is a a very early stage and comments are more than welcome.\n",

If that credit system fails under any circumstance miners get shafted, but remember miners aren't one body coming debating with each other whether or not to raise or accept something from somebody, they are a body of machines just saying we agree that these transactions have been processed and this code has been executed. Per reputation systems, and whether or not to accept certain ones, that could leave a healthy portion of miners getting the shaft in their decision if a large set of miners decide to take on the risk...and should they fail there's an attack on the miners who chose not to take the risk as the losses are effectively socialized. \n",

If the author of the contract deems that certain addresses (knowing by the time of writing the contract, or _programatically_ deciding on what conditions lead to an address earning _trust_) are trustable, it can turn off this feature for calls originating from them.\n\nThe current proposal is that happens via an opcode, e.g. the sender still has to have enough gas to execute the contract up to the point this opcode is executed. No one outside of the contract can execute that opcode on behalf of it and the contract needs to have enough balance to cover it. `PAYGAS` must check that the supplied `limit` exceeds or equals the current balance held by the contract.\n",

It is the fallback function, which is called when no data is being sent (i.e. regular value transfer):\n\n```\ncontract Sample {\n    function() {\n        if (msg.sender == owner) {\n            assembly { paygas(200000) }\n            // do costly housekeeping\n            return\n        }\n\n        // it isn't the owner, but we still do more than 21000 gas worth of execution\n        // and lets cover the difference, but only if there's meaningful value being sent\n        if (msg.value > 2 eth) {\n            assembly { paygas(20000) }\n            // do something\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThe above code could also decide to use different gas values based on what gas limit was provided by the caller. If paygas > totalgas, that means the contract is paying in full.\n\nIt also means that there must be enough gas limit supplied to reach and execute the code until and including the `paygas` instruction.\n",

    "body": "I believe the contract-sponsored transactions will have an enormous impact on overall user experience and can potentially widen the Ethereum adoption. As you don't have to have ETH to call certain methods in the contract if your address is white-listed in the contract.\r\n\r\nI'm still a noob in Ethereum, so please tell me if the following proposal is possible. Essentially it is an incentive model for miners to include zero-gas-price transactions in a block.\r\nThis solution doesn't require a separate opcode.\r\n\r\n1. An end user creates a transaction with proper gas amount and zero gas price (`tx1`)\r\n2. The miner doesn't discard the transaction but checks if the contract the transaction is calling has a predefined `rebate` function and checks if conditions are met to get a refund\r\n3. The miner creates a new transaction (`tx2`) that calls the `rebate` function (the arguments are the hash of `tx1` and miner's address)\r\n4. The miner includes both `tx1` and `tx2` in the block\r\n\r\nIs it possible in theory?",
