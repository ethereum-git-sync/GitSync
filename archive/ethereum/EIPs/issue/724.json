This should include wallets: Mist for example assumes 0 decimals if no other standard is set\r\n2) Remove decimals from the standard and most libraries and encourage its deprecation\r\n3) Encourage all new tokens to coalesce into 18 decimals",

Requiring 18 decimals gives you one of two choices: either allow people to hold \"partial API credits\", which may be confusing to users, or give your token a very high per-unit valuation, which may also be confusing to users.\r\n\r\nTo solve the light client issue, perhaps require tokens to issue an event on genesis with their lite-client-pertinent parameters.",

    "body": "> Example: consider an API token where 1 unit gives access to a functionality worth $5. Requiring 18 decimals gives you one of two choices: either allow people to hold \"partial API credits\", which may be confusing to users, or give your token a very high per-unit valuation, which may also be confusing to users.\r\n\r\nI think the case of non-divisable tokens is a pretty good usecase; where a token represents a non-divisable thing. Such as tokens representing membership or Beertoken (where one wei would be one atto-beer). But I'd rather see the a boolean: `isDivisable` or something like that, where anything divisable would always use 18 decimals. \r\n\r\nAnd I don't think this necessarily is tied to #223, but I agree not to retroactively change ERC20. This should be a new ERC. ",

This could be enabled with a flag rather than an int, although then it would still require a query of the blockchain to find out its value and so doesn't help the offline use case.\r\n\r\nHard-coding decimals to 18 makes it impossible to have an indivisible token (the token itself can handle indivisibility inside its own contract but what about partial token transfer on exchanges for example?).

    "body": "I agree. A token can be indivisible and still have 18 decimal points that aren't used, and in the implementation, just fail if someone tries to send less than 1. \r\n\r\nAn app that isn't aware of the indivisibility, would just present your balance as 1.000000000000000000 (which any reasonable app would just display 1), and it will fail when sending less than 1.\r\n\r\nSame things for an exchange: it can allow to sell fractions of the token,  it just needs to alert the user that they won't be able to withdrawal floating point amounts.\r\n\r\nPersonally, I decided to go forward and update the [ERC20 example on the homepage](https://www.ethereum.org/token#the-code) to have 18 decimals as the strongly suggested default. No change on the ERC at all.",

    "body": "So, we have two tokens, one to 8 d.p. and one to 18 d.p and both were deliberate calculated decisions that actually make sense to us.\r\n\r\nIt makes no sense for the first to be subdivided to smaller fractions because there is no utility in those smaller numbers - but I would have to add MORE code to ensure that all transfers are rounded to 8 dp? That really makes no sense to me at all.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, accepting but disregarding the fractions below the 8 dp range also makes no sense because the remainder bits would be worthless yet charged for in an exchange.\r\n\r\nTo summarise, the argument for 18 is because we have a standard that\r\n1) Wallets developers can't get right?\r\n2) Token programmers can't get right?\r\n3) ? \r\n\r\nI can see no valid justification for either #1 or #2. \r\n",
