I assume a hacky way to do this is to call `eth_getBlock*` and see if the response includes a `baseFeePerGas` field. This will tell you if the chain _currently_ supports 1559, but obviously not if it will support it in the future. I don't think there is a way right now to know what capabilities the chain will have in the future anyways. ",
