  "body": "Hello,\r\n\r\nWe'd like someone to take notes on the all core devs call this Friday (#66). The call is typically 60-90 minutes. See sample notes from previous calls listed [here](https://github.com/ethereum/pm/blob/master/README.md). These notes are important and extremely helpful for later review, since the all core devs process is central to Ethereum governance.\r\n\r\nYou should attempt to transcribe as much of the content of the meeting as faithfully as you can. You should also record the list of meeting attendees. The meeting will be recorded, so you can refer back to the recording to finish the notes as necessary.\r\n\r\nNotes should be posted as a PR on this repository, and are open for anyone to contribute to. Preliminary notes should be posted within 24 hours after the end of the meeting. Final notes with links to relevant documents, issues, and repositories, cross-referenced against the recording video with timed links, should be posted within a week after the end of the meeting.\r\n\r\nPlease do not hesitate to let me know if anything is unclear!\r\n\r\nThanks :)\r\n\r\nLane\r\n",
