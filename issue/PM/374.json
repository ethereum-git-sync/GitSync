    "body": "I might not be able to join the call (@tvanepps is hosting), but want to share some observations using 1559 over the past few weeks.\r\n\r\nIt seems like some applications pre-generate transactions for wallets to sign and set both the `maxPriorityFeePerGas` and `maxFeePerGas` to the same value, at ~2x the current `baseFeePerGas`. Here is an example from matcha.xyz on MetaMask (not to pick on matcha, I've experienced this across many applications): \r\n\r\n<img width=\"1243\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2021-09-01 at 7 07 57 PM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9390255/131864089-fcf9c354-e3ab-4223-9d00-f0220b965b2d.png\">\r\n\r\nMy intuition is that the application or the library it uses to generate transactions probably doesn't have 1559 support and sets both fields to a legacy `gasPrice` value or something. I really see no case when it makes sense for `maxFee` to be exactly equal to `maxPriorityFee`: either you are in a low-demand mode, and `maxPriorityFee` should be a few gwei, or you are in a high-demand mode, and you should set `maxPriorityFee` to, say, the 80th or 90th percentile `maxPriorityFee` from the past handful of blocks [0]. Legacy transactions are processed using `maxPriorityFee` == `maxFee`, but if we can save users money at the wallet layer, it makes sense to modify the txn to do so. \r\n\r\nPerhaps this is something that wallets can catch and fix? It might be a bit hacky, but something like if the `maxFeePerGas` is exactly equal to the `maxPriorityFeePerGas` in an application-generated transaction, then either alert the user or update the values behind the scenes based on the wallet's own oracle? \r\n\r\nOn this last note, it seems like the oracles from wallets have improved over the past couple weeks :-) \r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\n[0] I haven't run the numbers on this, but I suspect when >3 blocks are 100% full, it is likely a good indication we've moved from one mode to the other. \r\n",
