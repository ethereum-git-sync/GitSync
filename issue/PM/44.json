There were \"rumours\" about skipping Casper FFG to go straight to Sharded Casper. They way I see it is that Sharded Casper is much further away in terms of implementation than Casper FFG (as far as I know there are already couple of implementations of it). So I would like people to think about pros/cons of changing the Roadmap so we can discuss it, if it is appropriate place.\r\n\r\nI should be able to join the call tomorrow and give a quick update on Turbo-Geth.",

That said, I'd strongly oppose adding restrictions to CREATE2 to solve this problem at EVM level. The right layer of the ecosystem for programming language paternalism of the type that potentially impacts legitimate functionality is Solidity/Vyper/other HLLs, and banning external calls or dependence on environmentals for CREATE2 in Vyper (possibly with exceptions, like a standardized variable for `time_created`) seems like something that's fundamentally very reasonable to do.",
