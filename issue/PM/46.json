My recent updates on Turbo-Geth are in these blog posts: https://medium.com/@akhounov/recent-data-on-turbo-geth-performance-f7fb28b06a65, https://medium.com/@akhounov/turbo-geth-grant-and-disk-usage-update-92d0aa9ffd38\r\n\r\nI will be presenting some new ideas at the ECDC tomorrow, will write a blog about them several days after that.\r\n\r\nI am still planning to write a new Account Abstraction EIP (based on the existing one - 859, but without mandatory nonce, without CREATE2 embedded, and with transaction hash changing once tx is in the block). Also based on information here: https://ethresear.ch/t/a-recap-of-where-we-are-at-on-account-abstraction/1721\r\n\r\nThe item I would add on the agenda if I was on the call is changing network_id in Constantinople (and perhaps even change network_id every time there is a hard-fork). This is to remove some DAO-fork specific code from p2p code, as well as cleaner separation at every future fork. EIP has not been written yet.\r\n",

    "body": "Trying to gauge interest before writing an EIP: It might be a good idea to charge \"external access\" in a similar vein as EIP 1078: For example, in order to work around the \"empt code leads to successful call\" problem, Solidity always does an `extcodesize` before each `call`. Contracts basically pay twice for loading that account from disk. Gas costs could be changed so that this is only paid once per call frame or even only once per transaction. This would also make using libraries much cheaper, if you call certain functions multiple times.",
