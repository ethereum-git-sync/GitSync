    "body": "Regarding ProgPoW here is a summary of the current status (to my knowledge) of the development efforts:\r\n\r\n- [Parity](https://github.com/paritytech/parity-ethereum/pull/9762) and [Geth](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/17731) have pending PRs that add support for the ProgPoW algorithm\r\n- There are two distinct CUDA & OpenCL open source miner implementations: https://github.com/AndreaLanfranchi/ethminer and https://github.com/EthersocialNetwork/ethminer/\r\n- On the 11.12.2018 a ProgPoW testnet titled [Gangnam](http://boot.gangnam.ethdevops.io/) has been launched which successfully transitioned from Ethash to ProgPoW on block 3000\r\n- The testnet stalled during the first ProgPoW epoch transition. The root cause for this issue was that the only active GPU miner on the network was using an outdated miner that crashed during the epoch transition. The issue was already fixed on a more recent version. Since then the testnet completed 3 additional epoch transitions without any problems.\r\n- ProgPow support was added to Open Ethereum Pool (an open source ethereum mining pool) https://github.com/gangnamtestnet/open-ethereum-pool.\r\n- Verification benchmarks: A well-optimized implementation should end up being about just 2x slower than the ethash verification as there is twice as much data read per iteration. (source https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/17731#issuecomment-424519942)\r\n\r\nPlease feel free to amend the list in case I forgot something important",

Gangnam test network is only proving there is 1 miner (or two) working in bundle with a modified (unstable labelled) version of geth and parity which are mininig 99.9% empty blocks. \r\n\r\nWe have no transactions, not many nodes to share consensus, there are no rigs mining (at the moment of this writing the overall hashrate is 42Mh and my test rig alone is producing 36Mh). \r\n\r\nThis is not an appropriate test over a chain which holds value for almost 16 billions USD.\r\nCan you imagine what if something goes wrong ? Something we're not imaging as we haven't undergone the heavy stress tests ?\r\n\r\nLet's be honest.\r\n\r\nAt current prices we're at almost double revenue than 1 month ago. Reward cut-off will hit both GPU miners and ASIC miners but be sure will hit harder on the ones who overinvested.\r\n\r\nProgPoW will come, I'm pretty sure ... but not within 15 days.",

    "body": "Let me take some notes here \r\n\r\n**Arg.1** Although we had plenty of time with the development of ProgPoW ( 7 months since the announcement of algo & 3 weeks from testnet launch 😂 ) we can't enable them since it is not \"tested on real life\" and it is not ready since we already have core clients ready but we didn't prepared for \"all the other clients\" but we did some bug-patch hardforks without them 😂\r\n\r\n**Arg.2** We didn't prepare for the side-effect of Constantinople and EIP-1234 although we already know there is an asic miner available for ethereum and EIP-1234 will make the situation worse than ever and will allow Mr. Wu's invasion toward ethereum network more easily.\r\n\r\n**Arg.3** And ProgPoW is likely to be rejected now and afterwards since there will be no GPU miners left to support the fork after they are being bankrupted by asics and the central bank decision to cut the mining rewards without convincing them\r\n\r\nAm I right? @vbuterin @5chdn @Souptacular @ppratscher @AndreaLanfranchi @holiman @cryptozeny Do you think so??",

    "body": "Friends, this is obviously an important topic to many of us, but this is not the right forum for debate. This particular thread is intended for planning this Friday's meeting, not for in-depth discussion or debate about individual topics. Scrolling through dozens or hundreds of messages makes Hudson's and my life difficult as we need to review everything to plan for the meeting--it makes it hard to find relevant stuff among all of the messages.\r\n\r\nI think the [Fellowship of Ethereum Magicians forum](https://ethereum-magicians.org) is a reasonable place to continue the debate--would one of you like to open a thread there instead? Feel free to post the link here if you do. Thanks.",
