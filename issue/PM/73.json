    "body": "For the record, this is my recollection of how we arrived at 7.28M, feel free to tweak if I've gotten anything wrong:\r\n\r\n1. @vbuterin suggested six weeks, which he said would put us around block 7.25-7.3M.\r\n1. A couple of folks including myself asked if we could do it sooner, but the consensus was that we wanted a bit more time for updating tests, maybe rolling out on a new testnet, etc.\r\n1. @5chdn proposed Feb. 27, which falls on a Wednesday, and also happens to be during a quiet week between ETHDenver and EthCC.\r\n1. I used a [simulation script](https://gist.github.com/lrettig/801bff97cd668a0ae9227cad8f9c67fb) to look at predicted block times and numbers, with the latest block height, difficulty, and timestamp. All of the details were shared to AllCoreDevs, [starting here](https://gitter.im/ethereum/AllCoreDevs?at=5c41eb5827611d4204c41592).\r\n1. I did sensitivity analysis on network hashpower and current average blocktime. Based on this analysis I expect block 7.28M to occur between 00:00 and 09:00 UTC on 2019-02-27, the target date,\r\n\r\n@naikmyeong we agreed that it makes sense to target upgrades to occur mid-week so it's more likely developers will be online and so that people aren't forced to work weekends.",

    "body": "I made this reddit post:\r\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/aiy5ns/uncle_rates_more_node_efficiency_or_less/\r\nand this spreadsheet:\r\nhttps://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1SZn6_MuOciDI_B20KqqeHtpK9yAhHIgGdpVH-SDLRnU/edit?usp=sharing\r\n\r\nbecause I'm seriously worried and scared about how uncle rates are going down. \r\nUncle rates are going down linearly since mid 2018, so it is hard to say that is because of more efficient nodes, one of the most important bug in this area was fixed just recently ( parity client, [#9954](https://github.com/paritytech/parity-ethereum/pull/9954)) .\r\n\r\nSo i think that the problem is more and more centralization on the ethereum blockchain for two reason:\r\n1) falling price in fiat currency (less minig reward in fiat currency)\r\n2) asics mining\r\n\r\nThe first issue is something that could be adjusted by economic incentives (disincentives) given enough time BUT if we are experiencing ( and I think so) a massive switch on asics mining every single day with ethash is very dangerus for the future of the entire project as a truly decentralized blockchain. \r\n\r\nIn my opinion the ProgPow (or other asic resistant algos) implementation actually is the most important issue by far, even far more the important CostantiNOPEles saga.

    "body": "@5chdn sure, I know in deep a medium sized mining farm  with a good ( i think) efficiency and actually they are in the position to quit ether mining or swich to asics,   .\r\n I think that the actual reward/difficulty ratio for GPU mining is telling that there are more and more players that are mining with \"better\" hardware than GPU only and thatthis GPU unconfortable enviorment started with asics arrival on the market, not only because the price drop.\r\nI'm sorry because I can't produce in deep analysis with numbers and clearly the actual low ether mining reward for GPU miniers could be just temporary.\r\n In my experience **Asics are the foundation of big centralized mininig farms**, expecialy if there is one or two producers/miners/stakeholders, bitcoin is an example of what I mean.\r\n\r\nBig miners are more efficient, they use professional or custom services for transactions and new blocks propagation, I suppose that how the actual uncle rate is dropping is directly related with more centralizzation over big mining farms that are using asics mining.\r\n",

It was a blanket rollout of the better block propagation technology over a short window of time. It is not driven by some special \"better propagation services used by mining pools\" - the competitive technology advantages you believe exist at the large miner level are big foot sightings. You would be embarrassed at the way many of these firms/facilities operate.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure how lowered uncle rates is a scary thing - it theoretically increases total network throughput via lowered block times and higher miner reward per block.",

At least we know (now) that some kind of auditing is going on.\r\nThis, nevertheless, in my very personal opinion, tombstones any value in AllCoreDevs meetings and related streams: they're becoming only a report on the current status on \"researches\" most people (unless highly skilled) don't understand.\r\nI (mistakenly) thought the team had decisional powers (like eg. for issuance reduction) but apparently this matter has greatly involved powerful lobbies.\r\nWhat disturbs me is the lack of clarity and consistency.\r\n\r\nThanks anyway.",

An audit process will take months to complete trying to establish fixed points of reference on economies and power balances which are changing day by day, hour by hour. As said elsewhere act NOW (in favour or against) ... do not promise an action will be taken \"in future\" ... this is no decision at all and keeps miners hung by their fingers to wishful thinking.",

That’s how you let the community vote: you put it in, and the longest chain wins.\r\n\r\nProof-of-work was engineered to put an end to the stress of consensus. You simply let people vote - with their hashpower.

    "body": "@cartercarlson\r\n> I haven't seen many developers vocally support ProgPow that don't somehow directly or indirectly benefit from it\r\n\r\nThe discussions I've seen here have had far more to do with centralization, the health of the network, and the original intent of ETHHash.  It's not clear that these factors are strong enough to outweigh all the others.  The fact that GPU vs. ASIC has financial consequences for miners is part of makes this decision so hard.\r\n\r\n>Ethereum's end goal is PoS\r\n\r\nvs.\r\n\r\n> 1. c) Outlook: PoS finality gadget on PoW chain (Serenity)\r\n\r\nSomeone please tell me if I'm wrong, but PoW isn't going away any time soon.  If it's going away eventually I'd like to know when and how.\r\n\r\n",
