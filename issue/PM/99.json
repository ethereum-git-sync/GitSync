    "body": "I would like to discuss what EIPs are \"getting on the list\" for Istanbul. The discussion in the all-core-devs chat was to move the deadline to this call.\r\n\r\n> This is our first time through the EIP driven network upgrade process, so I don’t think any of these rules are hard and fast but are taken more of a measure of what EIPs are viable for this specific network upgrade. The fact there is a document that can be pointed to and a person willing to attend calls and advocate on FEM I think are the two strongest indicators, aside from the next checkpoint which is actual implementation in clients.\r\n\r\nThis is a good summary from [FEM](https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/hardfork-meta-eip-1679-istanbul-discussion/3207/46?u=madeoftin) but, I don't think there is consensus on this yet.\r\n\r\nThere is currently a list of 35. 24 have been merged as Draft.\r\nhttps://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Mgo7mJ6b6wimUwafsMo1l-b44uec28E_Hq8EQ7YdeEM/edit#gid=0\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1226869/58341288-e4d6a600-7e1b-11e9-89b6-d15ebd87a7b5.png)\r\n)\r\n^ Current status of the EIPs on that list regarding checkpoint 1. Reaching 4 means it has been merged as draft.\r\n\r\nWhich of these make it past checkpoint 1 (are considered for Istanbul)? How do we decide?\r\n\r\n#### Questions\r\n\r\n* Is there a need to actively reduce this list before the next deadline, or can we let the deadline reduce itself as different EIPs are worked on themselves?\r\n\r\n* Is there a person/persons going to manage this process?\r\n\r\n* What does the process for this look like? (As a best guess)\r\n\r\n * What are concerns of a list this large? Is it due to the coordination involved?\r\n\r\nTwo EIPS I would like to bring up specifically in the context of Istanbul.\r\n* ethereum/EIPS/#2024\r\n* ethereum/EIPS/#2025\r\n",
