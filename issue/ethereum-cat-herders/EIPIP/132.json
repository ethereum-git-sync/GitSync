  "body": "I suggest that the repositories in `ethereum-cat-herders` be transferred to the `ethereum` organization and that a new team (`@ethereum/cat-herders`) be made with admin rights over the transferred repos.\r\n\r\nRationale:\r\n- Doing so would increase the discoverability of the ECH programs.\r\n- If the EIP insight, EIPIP meetings, and other ECH programs become actually part of Ethereum, then they ~~may~~ will seem more official.\r\n- The Ethereum foundation has money. Not sure if they'd give you any, but it'd be worth a shot :)\r\n- Other reasons I can't remember. I'll update this issue when I think of them.",

    "body": "I agree with the issues you raise. When I started learning about Ethereum governance earlier this year, it took me a few weeks of digging before I even realized ECH existed!\r\n\r\nHowever, I'm not sure transferring the repos to the `ethereum` organization is the best way to address the issues. The lack of discoverability and officialness might occur partly because of how muddled the official website is. For instance, the [governance page](https://ethereum.org/en/governance/) is an overwhelming word salad about anything related to governance. Same goes for the [get involved page](https://ethereum.org/en/community/get-involved/) for anyone who is looking for a way to get involved.\r\n\r\nI think editing those pages to offer a more prominent and simpler description of ECH's role (and maybe cleaning up the site content generally, while we're at it) might suffice. What do you think?",
