  "body": "A few recent PRs come up to update EIPs in FINAL status, e.g.\r\n- https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/pull/5311 want to add 165 interface detection to 173 ownable\r\n- https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/pull/5457 want to \"fix\" 712 to match early draft adoptors\r\n\r\nQuestion where do we draw the line to approve or disapprove such updates.\r\nMy proposal would be: any \r\n\r\n\r\nIMO pure editorial change that improves readability shall be allowed, but breaking change of the specificiation are not allowed for final. If an EIP intends to be a standard/protocol/interface, the behaviors mandated by spec shall not change after becoming FINAL.\r\n\r\nFor example, if the original spec is\r\n\r\n```solidity\r\ninterface {\r\n  function transfer(uint256 id);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis change shall be allowed after an EIP becomes FINAL:\r\n\r\n```solidity\r\ninterface {\r\n  function transfer(uint256 tokenId);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis change IMO shall NOT be allowed after an EIP becomes FINAL:\r\n\r\n```solidity\r\ninterface {\r\n  function transferToken(uint256 id);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is because the former is compatible with original. The latter is not.\r\n\r\nAlso discussed in https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/pull/5457#issuecomment-1216753081",

    "body": "EIPs in final status may not have any normative changes ever.\r\n\r\nEven if the EIP is wrong, a normative change is not allowed.\r\n\r\nReasoning: any implementation of EIP-####, (not including drafts, which should be properly called `EIP-#### (DRAFT)`) shall be compatible with another implementation of EIP-#### regardless of when the implementer read that specification.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nIt is my understanding and experience that typos, formatting, updating for editorial standards is allowed whenever. And I frequently contribute these kinds of changes.\r\n\r\nTypically the process is that I or somebody makes a PR and the original EIP author approves it, or if they are absent, and there is no reason to deny it then an EIP editor finds it uncontroversial, then they manually approve it.\r\n\r\nThis is what we are currently doing and I have not seen any controversy whatsoever on this approach.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nI have considered these issues that might come up and you can read a special caveat in ERC-721 about future proofing that standard. Specifically I am waiting for a 1.0.0 (SerVer) release of Solidity and expect that it will be appropriate to replace the text in ERC-721 with the 1.0.0 SemVer version if necessary.\r\n\r\nThis will very likely be uncontroversial if required, and also very likely not required or only extremely small changes required.",
