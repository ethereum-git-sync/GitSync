    "body": "To make this notion a more formal proposal:\r\n\r\n**Goal:** Separate notification systems for ERC editors/subscribers and EIP editors/subscribers.\r\n\r\n**Potential Solution:** Maintain a top-level GitHub repo for all EIPs, then facilitate the forking of GitHub repositories along \"EIP type\" so people can watch one repository or the other or both or neither.\r\n\r\n**Details**\r\n- continue w/ the main ethreum/EIPs repo as is, but fork out ERCs and Core-EIPs, each w/ maintainers and editors\r\n- create a technical and human process for periodically syncing between these repos, EIP bot would do a lot of the work here\r\n- human process, plus web app or spreadsheet, for proposed numbering the incoming EIPs / ERCs\r\n\r\n**Potential Advantages:** Ability to scale to more developers and more kinds of Ethereum improvement, while maintaining a cohesive process. Every time a community emerges for proposing standards, a new type is added and a fork is created.\r\n\r\n**Potential Problems:** Complexity, coordination, some need for central control / intervention. Who would manage the main EIPs repo? (probably the ECHs)\r\n\r\n\r\n",

    "body": "It is unclear to me what the advantage of starting with a fork are vs starting from scratch.  The ERCs repository would most likely diverge from the EIPs repository sufficiently to make merging upstream a very manual process.  For example, we probably would rewrite EIP-1 and the readme to be ERC focused, and we would probably want to rename the `EIPs` folder to `ERCs`.  We also likely would make changes to or totally scrap the Jekyll site from the fork.  Finally, we would likely delete all of the non ERC EIPs from the forked repository.  In the end, I don't think the ERC fork will align at all with the EIP base and we'll just end up bringing a bunch of unnecessary history with us into the new repository.",

    "body": "Thanks @poojaranjan!\r\n\r\n30 starts with saying \"Pooja introduces the topic, which stems from the decision made in the previous meeting\". [29](https://github.com/ethereum-cat-herders/EIPIP/blob/master/All%20EIPIP%20Meetings/Meeting%20029.md#2-should-ercs-be-moved-to-a-separate-repo) apparently lists the main problem of EIP editors not being familiar with the content of ERCs and not being capable of conducting their duties of review properly.\r\n\r\nI really wonder if that just means that more editors (including ERC editors) could be added to the EIP repository and based on proper conduct, \"ERC editors\" not familiar with Core EIPs will not approve such changes, and EIP editors not familiar with ERCs will not approve those. Wasn't the main argument always that if an editor makes a (honest/malicious) mistake it can always be easily reverted?\r\n\r\nSecond, probably the notion of EIP editors not being capable of reviewing ERCs stems from the core disagreement about the role of an editor. While probably it is not well described in EIP-1, the role was that of a person guiding and enforcing the formatting rules dictated by EIP-1. The role however did not include thorough technical review capability of the content. The Review / Last Call state supposed to accomplish that by inviting interested parties.\r\n\r\nWhat made the situation more of a grey area is that most EIP editors also participated in protocol level development (and ACD), hence were capable of providing technical review of Core EIPs -- while doing that technical review however they usually did not disclose whether they are doing a review as an editor or as a technical reviewer, contributing to the confusion.\r\n\r\nIf the role of the editor is purely for guiding through the process and ensuring formatting rules, then both \"EIP editors\" and \"ERC editors\" should be capable of reviewing any \"EIP/ERC\".",

    "body": "It is clear that the number of active editors to review EIPs and ERCs is really low and adding more editors is very much needed. We've published a [post inviting participation to become an EIP editor](https://medium.com/ethereum-cat-herders/become-an-eip-editor-337f4376bf29).  The challenging part is the interested applicant has to be familiar with the current process and best if he/she has actually participated in the process at some point in time. Hopefully, we get more people to volunteer. \r\n\r\nAs it appears to me, the bigger issue than \"not being capable of reviewing ERCs\" is actually \"not having a bandwidth of reviewing both ERCs & EIPs\". As one of the reviewers dropped looking into ERCs, the number of open PRs started to getting higher. In long run, this will make it difficult for other editors to understand which PR needs to be reviewed and most of the ERC PR will be marked stale and eventually closed by the bot in absence of getting attention from editors. The current stats. of eips.ethereum.org suggest 113/141 ERC are in \"Draft\" status, obviously adding proposals that haven't been merged yet will increase the number. \r\n\r\nI understand, partially this can be taken care of by using labels but then it was highlighted that EIPs and ERCs are generally catering to different sets of users, so it would make sense to be separated. Those who are interested in getting feeds for EIPs should get EIP GitHub feeds and those who are interested in ERC repo feed can subscribe to ERC GitHub and those looking for both can subscribe to both of them. \r\n\r\nThe main goal of splitting EIP & ERC into different repositories is to simplify things for actively involved people.  However, if the proposal of having a separate GitHub is having more downside than the advantage as expected, it is worth reconsidering. \r\n\r\n> the EIP/ERC editor role is not well described in EIP-1\r\n\r\nAgreed, EIP-1 may need attention to describe the changes comprehensively. \r\n",

I know this separation is a recurring topic, but have not seen any convincing answer so far how does it help in getting more editors.\r\n\r\n@axic, you're correct, the separation is a recurring topic. I think, one of the driving forces behind this proposal is the [Discord conversation](https://discordapp.com/channels/595666850260713488/746566142700814426/821244976830611457) and perhaps @lightclient's interest to help with ERC PRs as editor. (Having someone in the picture is better than being blindsided). Once the ERC process is redefined and agreed upon, we can restart looking into more editors. As of now, I don't see separating guarantees more editors' participation.  \r\n\r\n> As you mention some of the downsides are discussed above and in the notes (numbering conflicts, question of setup, etc.)\r\n\r\nA possible solution has been identified for numbering conflicts and the process does not invite any major change except the GitHub repositories to request for an ERC number and submit a Pull Request to be merged. \r\n\r\nAs per my understanding, the showstopper here is unawareness of people having the right access to create a repo in Ethereum GitHub. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

I know this separation is a recurring topic, but have not seen any convincing answer so far how does it help in getting more editors.\r\n\r\nIf one wants to participate in EIP editing/reviewing, you would want to watch/subscribe to the EIPs repository.  If you do this today, your inbox is flooded with notifications for both EIPs and ERCs (along with a smattering of others).  Inversely, if you want to participate in ERC editing, you get a large volume of notifications you don't care about related to EIPs.\r\n\r\nBy splitting into two repositories, people can receive more targeted notifications specifically related to their area of interest, rather than being spammed by notifications that they have to manually filter (automated filtering of ERC/EIP is possible, but non-trivial).\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nNote: Even if we agree (which not everyone does) that EIP editing should be purely a bureaucratic process that could be fully automated or farmed out to low-skilled laborers, the problem of EIP *reviewers* is still present.",

    "body": "Ok, thanks for the clarification.\r\n\r\nWe do need to address the noise issue.\r\n\r\nAgain I go back to using git and GitHub. Why not use GitHub forks of the main EIPs repo for each Specs team? There would be specialized Editors and Herders for each type of system (Eth1, Eth2, Wallet, NFT, FungibleToken, etc). Probably the latter three would start w/ an ERCs fork. Comments and changes to a PR happen on the appropriate fork of EIPs, and this git repo is periodically sync'd back to the main EIPs repo. This way the EIPs stay in a pool of available standards.",
