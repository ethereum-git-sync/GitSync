This login uses a familiar username-password pair that would allow logins to happen from any device or environment without the need for external libraries and extensions like Web3.\r\n\r\n# Motivation\r\nMany DApps that perform some form of personalization need to identify the user. Consider, for example, the case of a popular DApp - [CryptoKitties](https://cryptokitties.co). CryptoKitties is a web based DApp and allows users to view, buy, sell and _breed_ CryptoKitties. The only way to login into the application is using MetaMask which is a Web3 injector. It is not possible to view _My kitties_ using a device that doesn't have MetaMask installed even if I do not intend to make any transactions.\r\n\r\nDAuth will enable DApps to allow users to establish their identity by proving the ownership of their Ethereum address. \r\n\r\n# Design \r\nWe first describe the _Authentication Game_ which takes place to authenticate a user.\r\n\r\n## 0. Registration\r\nA user registers by setting up a HTTP server (called the Dauth server). The user generates a password and a public-private key pair and stores the private key and the hash of the password on the server. Then, registers a username on the smart contract by providing the desired username, the public key and the address of the DAuth server.\r\n\r\nAll usernames on the contract are unique.\r\n\r\n## 1. DApp Login\r\nTo login into a DApp, the user provides the following to the endpoint that performs the authentication on the DApp.\r\n- **Code** : This is a random string that identifies the current authentication session. The authentication will go through only once for a given code.\r\n- **HashCode** : `sha3(sha3(password), code)`\r\n- **Username** : The username that was registered and confirmed on the smart contract.\r\n\r\nIn order to verify this request, the DApp will fetch the public key and DAuth server address from the smart contract.\r\n\r\nThe DApp shall then generate a _Secret_ string - which may be a random string. It will then pass the following parameters to the DAuth server's verification endpoint.\r\n- **Code** : As provided by the user\r\n- **HashCode** : As provided by the user\r\n- **Username** : As provided by the user\r\n- **Cipher** : The _Secret string_ encrypted using the user's public key\r\n\r\n## 2. DAuth server verification\r\nThe DAuth server on receiving the request from the DApp, fetches the hash of the password and the private key from its database corresponding to the username in the request.\r\n\r\nIt then validates if `HashCode = sha3(hash of password, code)`\r\n\r\nIf the HashCode is valid, and the code has not been used before, it tries to decrypt the Cipher using the private key and sends the decrypted value back to the DApp\r\n\r\n## 3. Verification\r\nThe DApp may authenticate the user if the response from the DAuth server is the same as the Secret it used to generate the Cipher.\r\n\r\n# Specification\r\n\r\n## Smart Contract\r\n### set\r\n```\r\n function set(string username, string dauth_url, string public_key) public returns (bool)\r\n\r\n event NewUser(address from, string username, bool success);\r\n```\r\nMust insert a mapping between the `msg.sender` and the username, DAuth Server address, and public key.\r\n\r\nMust  emit `NewUser(address, username, true)` if successfully created, `NewUser(address, username, false)` if it fails.\r\n### getUsername\r\n```\r\n function getUsername(address user_address) public view returns (string)\r\n```\r\nReturns the username associated with a given address. Returns a blank string if no username exists for that address.\r\n\r\n### getAddress\r\n```\r\n function getAddress(string username) public view returns (address)\r\n```\r\nReturns the address associated with the username. Returns a blank string if the username is not registered.\r\n### getDauthUrl\r\n```\r\n function getDauthUrl(string username) public view returns (string)\r\n```\r\nReturns the DAuth Server address associated with the username. Returns a blank string if the username is not registered. \r\n### getDauthPublicKey\r\n```\r\n function getDauthPublicKey(string username) public view returns (string)\r\n```\r\nReturns the public key associated with the username. Returns a blank string if the username is not registered.\r\n\r\n\r\n## DAuth Server\r\nThe DAuth server must expose two endpoints\r\n### Verification Endpoint\r\nThis is the endpoint using a POST request to the DAuth Server address. This takes as parameters\r\n```\r\n{\r\n    username : string,\r\n    cipher : string,\r\n    code : string,\r\n    hashcode : string\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf verification is successful, returns \r\n```\r\n200\r\n{ data : <decrypted value> }\r\n```\r\nelse,\r\n```\r\n403\r\n{ data : <reason for failure> }\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Login Page \r\nThis is a GET request to the DAuth Server address. This takes as query parameter the verifier url.\r\nOn the webpage it must accept the username and password, generate the code and hashcode and transmit the username, code and hashcode to the verifier (DApp).\r\n\r\n\r\n## DApp\r\nThe Dapp must provide an endpoint called the _verifier URL_ that is a GET request that can be accessed from a web browser. This endpoint gets the following query parameters : code, hashcode, username. This endpoint may respond accordingly based on the success of the login.\r\n\r\n# Implementation\r\n## Smart Contract\r\nThe smart contract is hosted on the Rinkeby testnet - [Link](https://rinkeby.etherscan.io/address/0xb19d6bf34cf6cecc50c4a73c38f54defcf9e8f6a)\r\n\r\n## DAuth Server\r\nA user may run a self hosted DAuth Server by cloning [this](https://github.com/madhavanmalolan/dauth/tree/master/server) repository.\r\nFor the sake of simplicity and a demo, a DAuth Server has been setup at [dauth.co](https://dauth.co) on which users may choose to host their credentials if they are not able to host a server on their own.\r\n\r\n## Verifier\r\nThe DApps may use a [the promise based nodejs implementation](https://github.com/madhavanmalolan/), which abstracts out all implementation details.\r\n\r\n## Source\r\nAll the code for the smart contract and the Dauth Server are opensourced at [this repository](https://github.com/madhavanmalolan/dauth).\r\n\r\n# Demo \r\nA demo is available at [dauth.co](https://dauth.co)\r\n\r\n# More details\r\nA white paper is made available that digs deeper into technical details : [dauth.pdf](https://github.com/madhavanmalolan/dauth/blob/master/dauth.pdf)\r\n",

    "body": "Apologies there, by referring to MetaMask, I meant it as an example of a web3 provider. Though signing with MetaMask is free of gas, there are the following issues.\r\n- users still need to install an extension to enable web3 on their traditional browser. Though it is easy to install, it is not necessarily available on all platforms. Consider the case of accessing the dapp from a mobile application for example using an embedded Web view. I do not agree with the argument t around it being built in on all clients. \r\n- Users lose portability. You cannot login into your Crypto Kitties account from your friends' device unless you type in the 12 word phrase and then need to remember to delete it. \r\n\r\n- Using MetaMask couples payment with identity. Consider scams (pointing out because I have come across one such), which ask you to make a small transaction to _login_. But the actual amount that shows up while paying is magnitudes higher - for someone not paying attention, it is easy to click submit. Dauth decouples payment from identity. The same way an SSN is different from a credit card number. \r\n\r\nThe way the EIP is an improvement is that it allows for a much simpler user experience without making assumptions like web3 being available on client side. \r\n\r\nDoes that answer your question? \r\n\r\n",

The governance is the only improvement when compared to OAuth. \r\n\r\nOther improvements are over existing authentication that exist as of today on top of Ethereum. ",
