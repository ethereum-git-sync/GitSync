A single deployed contract may include any combination of fungible tokens, non-fungible tokens or other configurations (e.g. semi-fungible tokens).\r\n\r\n## Abstract\r\n\r\nThis standard outlines a smart contract interface that can represent any number of fungible and non-fungible token types. Existing standards such as ERC-20 require deployment of separate contracts per token type. The ERC-721 standard's token ID is a single non-fungible index and the group of these non-fungibles is deployed as a single contract with settings for the entire collection. In contrast, the ERC-1155 Multi Token Standard allows for each token ID to represent a new configurable token type, which may have its own metadata, supply and other attributes.\r\n\r\nThe `_id` argument contained in each function's argument set indicates a specific token or token type in a transaction.\r\n\r\n## Motivation\r\n\r\nTokens standards like ERC-20 and ERC-721 require a separate contract to be deployed for each token type or collection. This places a lot of redundant bytecode on the Ethereum blockchain and limits certain functionality by the nature of separating each token contract into its own permissioned address. With the rise of blockchain games and platforms like Enjin Coin, game developers may be creating thousands of token types, and a new type of token standard is needed to support them. However, ERC-1155 is not specific to games and many other applications can benefit from this flexibility.\r\n\r\nNew functionality is possible with this design such as transferring multiple token types at once, saving on transaction costs. Trading (escrow / atomic swaps) of multiple tokens can be built on top of this standard and it removes the need to \"approve\" individual token contracts separately. It is also easy to describe and mix multiple fungible or non-fungible token types in a single contract.\r\n\r\n## Specification\r\n\r\nThe key words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\", \"SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\", \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"MAY\", and \"OPTIONAL\" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.\r\n\r\n**Smart contracts implementing the ERC-1155 standard MUST implement all of the functions in the `ERC1155` interface.**\r\n\r\n**Smart contracts implementing the ERC-1155 standard MUST implement the ERC-165 `supportsInterface` function and MUST return the constant value `true` if `0xd9b67a26` is passed through the `interfaceID` argument.**\r\n\r\n```solidity\r\npragma solidity ^0.5.9;\r\n\r\n/**\r\n    @title ERC-1155 Multi Token Standard\r\n    @dev See https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1155\r\n    Note: The ERC-165 identifier for this interface is 0xd9b67a26.\r\n */\r\ninterface ERC1155 /* is ERC165 */ {\r\n    /**\r\n        @dev Either `TransferSingle` or `TransferBatch` MUST emit when tokens are transferred, including zero value transfers as well as minting or burning (see \"Safe Transfer Rules\" section of the standard).\r\n        The `_operator` argument MUST be the address of an account/contract that is approved to make the transfer (SHOULD be msg.sender).\r\n        The `_from` argument MUST be the address of the holder whose balance is decreased.\r\n        The `_to` argument MUST be the address of the recipient whose balance is increased.\r\n        The `_id` argument MUST be the token type being transferred.\r\n        The `_value` argument MUST be the number of tokens the holder balance is decreased by and match what the recipient balance is increased by.\r\n        When minting/creating tokens, the `_from` argument MUST be set to `0x0` (i.e. zero address).\r\n        When burning/destroying tokens, the `_to` argument MUST be set to `0x0` (i.e. zero address).        \r\n    */\r\n    event TransferSingle(address indexed _operator, address indexed _from, address indexed _to, uint256 _id, uint256 _value);\r\n\r\n    /**\r\n        @dev Either `TransferSingle` or `TransferBatch` MUST emit when tokens are transferred, including zero value transfers as well as minting or burning (see \"Safe Transfer Rules\" section of the standard).      \r\n        The `_operator` argument MUST be the address of an account/contract that is approved to make the transfer (SHOULD be msg.sender).\r\n        The `_from` argument MUST be the address of the holder whose balance is decreased.\r\n        The `_to` argument MUST be the address of the recipient whose balance is increased.\r\n        The `_ids` argument MUST be the list of tokens being transferred.\r\n        The `_values` argument MUST be the list of number of tokens (matching the list and order of tokens specified in _ids) the holder balance is decreased by and match what the recipient balance is increased by.\r\n        When minting/creating tokens, the `_from` argument MUST be set to `0x0` (i.e. zero address).\r\n        When burning/destroying tokens, the `_to` argument MUST be set to `0x0` (i.e. zero address).                \r\n    */\r\n    event TransferBatch(address indexed _operator, address indexed _from, address indexed _to, uint256[] _ids, uint256[] _values);\r\n\r\n    /**\r\n        @dev MUST emit when approval for a second party/operator address to manage all tokens for an owner address is enabled or disabled (absence of an event assumes disabled).        \r\n    */\r\n    event ApprovalForAll(address indexed _owner, address indexed _operator, bool _approved);\r\n\r\n    /**\r\n        @dev MUST emit when the URI is updated for a token ID.\r\n        URIs are defined in RFC 3986.\r\n        The URI MUST point to a JSON file that conforms to the \"ERC-1155 Metadata URI JSON Schema\".\r\n    */\r\n    event URI(string _value, uint256 indexed _id);\r\n\r\n    /**\r\n        @notice Transfers `_value` amount of an `_id` from the `_from` address to the `_to` address specified (with safety call).\r\n        @dev Caller must be approved to manage the tokens being transferred out of the `_from` account (see \"Approval\" section of the standard).\r\n        MUST revert if `_to` is the zero address.\r\n        MUST revert if balance of holder for token `_id` is lower than the `_value` sent.\r\n        MUST revert on any other error.\r\n        MUST emit the `TransferSingle` event to reflect the balance change (see \"Safe Transfer Rules\" section of the standard).\r\n        After the above conditions are met, this function MUST check if `_to` is a smart contract (e.g. code size > 0).

See \"Compatibility with other standards\" section.\r\n\r\n**_Scenario#4 :_** The receiver implements the necessary `ERC1155TokenReceiver` interface function(s) but returns an unknown value.\r\n* The transfer MUST be reverted.\r\n\r\n**_Scenario#5 :_** The receiver implements the necessary `ERC1155TokenReceiver` interface function(s) but throws an error.\r\n* The transfer MUST be reverted.\r\n\r\n**_Scenario#6 :_** The receiver implements the `ERC1155TokenReceiver` interface and is the recipient of one and only one balance change (e.g. `safeTransferFrom` called).\r\n* The balances for the transfer MUST have been updated before the `ERC1155TokenReceiver` hook is called on a recipient contract.\r\n* The transfer event MUST have been emitted to reflect the balance changes before the `ERC1155TokenReceiver` hook is called on the recipient contract.\r\n* One of `onERC1155Received` or `onERC1155BatchReceived` MUST be called on the recipient contract.\r\n* The `onERC1155Received` hook SHOULD be called on the recipient contract and its rules followed.\r\n    - See \"onERC1155Received rules\" for further rules that MUST be followed.\r\n* The `onERC1155BatchReceived` hook MAY be called on the recipient contract and its rules followed.\r\n    - See \"onERC1155BatchReceived rules\" for further rules that MUST be followed.\r\n\r\n**_Scenario#7 :_** The receiver implements the `ERC1155TokenReceiver` interface and is the recipient of more than one balance change (e.g. `safeBatchTransferFrom` called).\r\n* All balance transfers that are referenced in a call to an `ERC1155TokenReceiver` hook MUST be updated before the `ERC1155TokenReceiver` hook is called on the recipient contract.\r\n* All transfer events MUST have been emitted to reflect current balance changes before an `ERC1155TokenReceiver` hook is called on the recipient contract.\r\n* `onERC1155Received` or `onERC1155BatchReceived` MUST be called on the recipient as many times as necessary such that every balance change for the recipient in the scenario is accounted for.\r\n    - The return magic value for every hook call MUST be checked and acted upon as per \"onERC1155Received rules\" and \"onERC1155BatchReceived rules\".\r\n* The `onERC1155BatchReceived` hook SHOULD be called on the recipient contract and its rules followed.    \r\n    - See \"onERC1155BatchReceived rules\" for further rules that MUST be followed.\r\n* The `onERC1155Received` hook MAY be called on the recipient contract and its rules followed.    \r\n    - See \"onERC1155Received rules\" for further rules that MUST be followed.\r\n    \r\n**_Scenario#8 :_** You are the creator of a contract that implements the `ERC1155TokenReceiver` interface and you forward the token(s) onto another address in one or both of `onERC1155Received` and `onERC1155BatchReceived`.\r\n* Forwarding should be considered acceptance and then initiating a new `safeTransferFrom` or `safeBatchTransferFrom` in a new context.\r\n    - The prescribed keccak256 acceptance value magic for the receiver hook being called MUST be returned after forwarding is successful.\r\n* The `_data` argument MAY be re-purposed for the new context.\r\n* If forwarding fails the transaction MAY be reverted.\r\n    - If the contract logic wishes to keep the ownership of the token(s) itself in this case it MAY do so.\r\n    \r\n**_Scenario#9 :_** You are transferring tokens via a non-standard API call i.e. an implementation specific API and NOT `safeTransferFrom` or `safeBatchTransferFrom`.\r\n* In this scenario all balance updates and events output rules are the same as if a standard transfer function had been called.\r\n    - i.e. an external viewer MUST still be able to query the balance via a standard function and it MUST be identical to the balance as determined by `TransferSingle` and `TransferBatch` events alone.\r\n* If the receiver is a contract the `ERC1155TokenReceiver` hooks still need to be called on it and the return values respected the same as if a standard transfer function had been called. \r\n    - However while the `safeTransferFrom` or `safeBatchTransferFrom` functions MUST revert if a receiving contract does not implement the `ERC1155TokenReceiver` interface, a non-standard function MAY proceed with the transfer.\r\n    - See \"Implementation specific transfer API rules\".\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Rules\r\n\r\n**_safeTransferFrom rules:_**\r\n* Caller must be approved to manage the tokens being transferred out of the `_from` account (see \"Approval\" section).\r\n* MUST revert if `_to` is the zero address.\r\n* MUST revert if balance of holder for token `_id` is lower than the `_value` sent to the recipient.\r\n* MUST revert on any other error.\r\n* MUST emit the `TransferSingle` event to reflect the balance change (see \"TransferSingle and TransferBatch event rules\" section).\r\n* After the above conditions are met, this function MUST check if `_to` is a smart contract (e.g. code size > 0).

It MUST return the constant value `true` if `0x01ffc9a7` is passed through the `interfaceID` argument. This signifies ERC-165 support.\r\n  - It MUST return the constant value `true` if `0x4e2312e0` is passed through the `interfaceID` argument. This signifies ERC-1155 `ERC1155TokenReceiver` support.\r\n  - It MUST NOT consume more than 10,000 gas.\r\n    - This keeps it below the ERC-165 requirement of 30,000 gas, reduces the gas reserve needs and minimises possible side-effects of gas exhaustion during the call.\r\n\r\n**_Implementation specific transfer API rules:_**\r\n* If an implementation specific API function is used to transfer ERC-1155 token(s) to a contract, the `safeTransferFrom` or `safeBatchTransferFrom` (as appropriate) rules MUST still be followed if the receiver implements the `ERC1155TokenReceiver` interface. If it does not the non-standard implementation SHOULD revert but MAY proceed.    \r\n* An example:\r\n    1. An approved user calls a function such as `function myTransferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256[] calldata _ids, uint256[] calldata _values);`.\r\n    2. `myTransferFrom` updates the balances for `_from` and `_to` addresses for all `_ids` and `_values`.\r\n    3. `myTransferFrom` emits `TransferBatch` with the details of what was transferred from address `_from` to address `_to`.\r\n    4. `myTransferFrom` checks if `_to` is a contract address and determines that it is so (if not, then the transfer can be considered successful).\r\n    5. `myTransferFrom` calls `onERC1155BatchReceived` on `_to` and it reverts or returns an unknown value (if it had returned `bytes4(keccak256(\"onERC1155BatchReceived(address,address,uint256[],uint256[],bytes)\"))` the transfer can be considered successful).    \r\n    6. At this point `myTransferFrom` SHOULD revert the transaction immediately as receipt of the token(s) was not explicitly accepted by the `onERC1155BatchReceived` function.            \r\n    7. If however `myTransferFrom` wishes to continue it MUST call `supportsInterface(0x4e2312e0)` on `_to` and if it returns the constant value `true` the transaction MUST be reverted, as it is now known to be a valid receiver and the previous acceptance step failed. \r\n        - NOTE: You could have called `supportsInterface(0x4e2312e0)` at a previous step if you wanted to gather and act upon that information earlier, such as in a hybrid standards scenario.\r\n    8. If the above call to `supportsInterface(0x4e2312e0)` on `_to` reverts or returns a value other than the constant value `true` the `myTransferFrom` function MAY consider this transfer successful.\r\n        - __NOTE__: this MAY result in unrecoverable tokens if sent to an address that does not expect to receive ERC-1155 tokens.\r\n* The above example is not exhaustive but illustrates the major points (and shows that most are shared with `safeTransferFrom` and `safeBatchTransferFrom`):\r\n    - Balances that are updated MUST have equivalent transfer events emitted.\r\n    - A receiver address has to be checked if it is a contract and if so relevant `ERC1155TokenReceiver` hook function(s) have to be called on it. \r\n    - Balances (and events associated) that are referenced in a call to an `ERC1155TokenReceiver` hook MUST be updated (and emitted) before the `ERC1155TokenReceiver` hook is called.\r\n    - The return values of the `ERC1155TokenReceiver` hook functions that are called MUST be respected if they are implemented.    \r\n    - Only non-standard transfer functions MAY allow tokens to be sent to a recipient contract that does NOT implement the necessary `ERC1155TokenReceiver` hook functions. `safeTransferFrom` and `safeBatchTransferFrom` MUST revert in that case (unless it is a hybrid standards implementation see \"Compatibility with other standards\").\r\n\r\n**_Minting/creating and burning/destroying rules:_**\r\n* A mint/create operation is essentially a specialized transfer and MUST follow these rules:\r\n    - To broadcast the existence of a token ID with no initial balance, the contract SHOULD emit the `TransferSingle` event from `0x0` to `0x0`, with the token creator as `_operator`, and a `_value` of 0.\r\n    - The \"TransferSingle and TransferBatch event rules\" MUST be followed as appropriate for the mint(s) (i.e. singles or batches) however the `_from` argument MUST be set to `0x0` (i.e. zero address) to flag the transfer as a mint to contract observers.\r\n        - __NOTE:__ This includes tokens that are given an initial balance in the contract. The balance of the contract MUST also be able to be determined by events alone meaning initial contract balances (for eg. in construction) MUST emit events to reflect those balances too.            \r\n* A burn/destroy operation is essentially a specialized transfer and MUST follow these rules:\r\n    - The \"TransferSingle and TransferBatch event rules\" MUST be followed as appropriate for the burn(s) (i.e. singles or batches) however the `_to` argument MUST be set to `0x0` (i.e. zero address) to flag the transfer as a burn to contract observers.           \r\n    - When burning/destroying you do not have to actually transfer to `0x0` (that is impl specific), only the `_to` argument in the event MUST be set to `0x0` as above.\r\n* The total value transferred from address `0x0` minus the total value transferred to `0x0` observed via the `TransferSingle` and `TransferBatch` events MAY be used by clients and exchanges to determine the \"circulating supply\" for a given token ID.\r\n* As mentioned above mint/create and burn/destroy operations are specialized transfers and so will likely be accomplished with custom transfer functions rather than `safeTransferFrom` or `safeBatchTransferFrom`. If so the \"Implementation specific transfer API rules\" section would be appropriate.   \r\n    - Even in a non-safe API and/or hybrid standards case the above event rules MUST still be adhered to when minting/creating or burning/destroying.\r\n* A contract MAY skip calling the `ERC1155TokenReceiver` hook function(s) if the mint operation is transferring the token(s) to itself. In all other cases the `ERC1155TokenReceiver` rules MUST be followed as appropriate for the implementation (i.e. safe, custom and/or hybrid). \r\n\r\n\r\n##### A solidity example of the keccak256 generated constants for the various magic values (these MAY be used by implementation):\r\n\r\n```solidity\r\nbytes4 constant public ERC1155_ERC165 = 0xd9b67a26; // ERC-165 identifier for the main token standard.\r\nbytes4 constant public ERC1155_ERC165_TOKENRECEIVER = 0x4e2312e0; // ERC-165 identifier for the `ERC1155TokenReceiver` support (i.e. `bytes4(keccak256(\"onERC1155Received(address,address,uint256,uint256,bytes)\")) ^ bytes4(keccak256(\"onERC1155BatchReceived(address,address,uint256[],uint256[],bytes)\"))`).\r\nbytes4 constant public ERC1155_ACCEPTED = 0xf23a6e61; // Return value from `onERC1155Received` call if a contract accepts receipt (i.e `bytes4(keccak256(\"onERC1155Received(address,address,uint256,uint256,bytes)\"))`).\r\nbytes4 constant public ERC1155_BATCH_ACCEPTED = 0xbc197c81; // Return value from `onERC1155BatchReceived` call if a contract accepts receipt (i.e `bytes4(keccak256(\"onERC1155BatchReceived(address,address,uint256[],uint256[],bytes)\"))`).\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Compatibility with other standards\r\n\r\nThere have been requirements during the design discussions to have this standard be compatible with existing standards when sending to contract addresses, specifically ERC-721 at time of writing.\r\nTo cater for this scenario, there is some leeway with the revert logic should a contract not implement the `ERC1155TokenReceiver` as per \"Safe Transfer Rules\" section above, specifically \"Scenario#3 : The receiver does not implement the necessary `ERC1155TokenReceiver` interface function(s)\".\r\n\r\nHence in a hybrid ERC-1155 contract implementation an extra call MUST be made on the recipient contract and checked before any hook calls to `onERC1155Received` or `onERC1155BatchReceived` are made.\r\nOrder of operation MUST therefore be:\r\n1. The implementation MUST call the function `supportsInterface(0x4e2312e0)` on the recipient contract, providing at least 10,000 gas.\r\n2. If the function call succeeds and the return value is the constant value `true` the implementation proceeds as a regular ERC-1155 implementation, with the call(s) to the `onERC1155Received` or `onERC1155BatchReceived` hooks and rules associated.\r\n3. If the function call fails or the return value is NOT the constant value `true` the implementation can assume the recipient contract is not an `ERC1155TokenReceiver` and follow its other standard's rules for transfers. \r\n   \r\n*__Note that a pure implementation of a single standard is recommended__* rather than a hybrid solution, but an example of a hybrid ERC-1155/ERC-721 contract is linked in the references section under implementations.\r\n\r\nAn important consideration is that even if the tokens are sent with another standard's rules the *__ERC-1155 transfer events MUST still be emitted.__* This is so the balances can still be determined via events alone as per ERC-1155 standard rules.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Metadata\r\n\r\nThe URI value allows for ID substitution by clients. If the string `{id}` exists in any URI, clients MUST replace this with the actual token ID in hexadecimal form. This allows for a large number of tokens to use the same on-chain string by defining a URI once, for that large number of tokens.\r\n\r\n* The string format of the substituted hexadecimal ID MUST be lowercase alphanumeric: `[0-9a-f]` with no 0x prefix.\r\n* The string format of the substituted hexadecimal ID MUST be leading zero padded to 64 hex characters length if necessary.\r\n\r\nExample of such a URI: `https://token-cdn-domain/{id}.json` would be replaced with `https://token-cdn-domain/000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000004cce0.json` if the client is referring to token ID 314592/0x4CCE0.\r\n\r\n#### Metadata Extensions\r\n\r\nThe optional `ERC1155Metadata_URI` extension can be identified with the (ERC-165 Standard Interface Detection)[https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-165].\r\n\r\nIf the optional `ERC1155Metadata_URI` extension is included:\r\n* The ERC-165 `supportsInterface` function MUST return the constant value `true` if `0x0e89341c` is passed through the `interfaceID` argument.\r\n* _Changes_ to the URI MUST emit the `URI` event if the change can be expressed with an event (i.e. it isn't dynamic/programmatic).\r\n    - An implementation MAY emit the `URI` event during a mint operation but it is NOT mandatory. An observer MAY fetch the metadata uri at mint time from the `uri` function if it was not emitted.    \r\n* The `uri` function SHOULD be used to retrieve values if no event was emitted. \r\n* The `uri` function MUST return the same value as the latest event for an `_id` if it was emitted.\r\n* The `uri` function MUST NOT be used to check for the existence of a token as it is possible for an implementation to return a valid string even if the token does not exist.\r\n\r\n```solidity\r\npragma solidity ^0.5.9;\r\n\r\n/**\r\n    Note: The ERC-165 identifier for this interface is 0x0e89341c.\r\n*/\r\ninterface ERC1155Metadata_URI {\r\n    /**\r\n        @notice A distinct Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) for a given token.\r\n        @dev URIs are defined in RFC 3986.\r\n        The URI MUST point to a JSON file that conforms to the \"ERC-1155 Metadata URI JSON Schema\".        \r\n        @return URI string\r\n    */\r\n    function uri(uint256 _id) external view returns (string memory);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### ERC-1155 Metadata URI JSON Schema\r\n\r\nThis JSON schema is loosely based on the \"ERC721 Metadata JSON Schema\", but includes optional formatting to allow for ID substitution by clients.

As such, a simple overlay method is proposed to enable localization. If the metadata JSON file contains a `localization` attribute, its content MAY be used to provide localized values for fields that need it. The `localization` attribute should be a sub-object with three attributes: `uri`, `default` and `locales`. If the string `{locale}` exists in any URI, it MUST be replaced with the chosen locale by all client software.\r\n\r\n##### JSON Schema\r\n\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n    \"title\": \"Token Metadata\",\r\n    \"type\": \"object\",\r\n    \"properties\": {\r\n        \"name\": {\r\n            \"type\": \"string\",\r\n            \"description\": \"Identifies the asset to which this token represents\",\r\n        },\r\n        \"decimals\": {\r\n            \"type\": \"integer\",\r\n            \"description\": \"The number of decimal places that the token amount should display - e.g. 18, means to divide the token amount by 1000000000000000000 to get its user representation.\",\r\n        },\r\n        \"description\": {\r\n            \"type\": \"string\",\r\n            \"description\": \"Describes the asset to which this token represents\",\r\n        },\r\n        \"image\": {\r\n            \"type\": \"string\",\r\n            \"description\": \"A URI pointing to a resource with mime type image/* representing the asset to which this token represents.

To permit approval of a subset of token IDs, an interface such as [ERC-1761 Scoped Approval Interface](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1761) is suggested.\r\nThe counterpart `isApprovedForAll` provides introspection into any status set by `setApprovalForAll`.\r\n\r\nAn owner SHOULD be assumed to always be able to operate on their own tokens regardless of approval status, so should SHOULD NOT have to call `setApprovalForAll` to approve themselves as an operator before they can operate on them.  \r\n\r\n## Rationale\r\n\r\n### Metadata Choices\r\n\r\nThe `symbol` function (found in the ERC-20 and ERC-721 standards) was not included as we do not believe this is a globally useful piece of data to identify a generic virtual item / asset and are also prone to collisions. Short-hand symbols are used in tickers and currency trading, but they aren't as useful outside of that space.\r\n\r\nThe `name` function (for human-readable asset names, on-chain) was removed from the standard to allow the Metadata JSON to be the definitive asset name and reduce duplication of data. This also allows localization for names, which would otherwise be prohibitively expensive if each language string was stored on-chain, not to mention bloating the standard interface. While this decision may add a small burden on implementers to host a JSON file containing metadata, we believe any serious implementation of ERC-1155 will already utilize JSON Metadata.\r\n\r\n### Upgrades\r\n\r\nThe requirement to emit `TransferSingle` or `TransferBatch` on balance change implies that a valid implementation of ERC-1155 redeploying to a new contract address MUST emit events from the new contract address to replicate the deprecated contract final state. It is valid to only emit a minimal number of events to reflect only the final balance and omit all the transactions that led to that state. The event emit requirement is to ensure that the current state of the contract can always be traced only through events. To alleviate the need to emit events when changing contract address, consider using the proxy pattern, such as described in ERC-1538. This will also have the added benefit of providing a stable contract address for users.\r\n\r\n### Design decision: Supporting non-batch\r\n\r\nThe standard supports `safeTransferFrom` and `onERC1155Received` functions because they are significantly cheaper for single token-type transfers, which is arguably a common use case.\r\n\r\n### Design decision: Safe transfers only\r\n\r\nThe standard only supports safe-style transfers, making it possible for receiver contracts to depend on `onERC1155Received` or `onERC1155BatchReceived` function to be always called at the end of a transfer.\r\n\r\n### Guaranteed log trace\r\n\r\nAs the Ethereum ecosystem continues to grow, many dapps are relying on traditional databases and explorer API services to retrieve and categorize data. The ERC-1155 standard guarantees that event logs emitted by the smart contract will provide enough data to create an accurate record of all current token balances. A database or explorer may listen to events and be able to provide indexed and categorized searches of every ERC-1155 token in the contract.\r\n\r\n### Approval\r\n\r\nThe function `setApprovalForAll` allows an operator to manage one's entire set of tokens on behalf of the approver. It enables frictionless interaction with exchange and trade contracts.\r\n\r\nRestricting approval to a certain set of token IDs, quantities or other rules MAY be done with an additional interface or an external contract. The rationale is to keep the ERC-1155 standard as generic as possible for all use-cases without imposing a specific approval scheme on implementations that may not need it. Standard token approval interfaces can be used, such as the suggested [ERC-1761 Scoped Approval Interface](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/1761) which is compatible with ERC-1155.\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\n\r\nThis standard can be used to represent multiple token types for an entire domain. Both fungible and non-fungible tokens can be stored in the same smart-contract.\r\n\r\n### Batch Transfers\r\n\r\nThe `safeBatchTransferFrom` function allows for batch transfers of multiple token IDs and values. The design of ERC-1155 makes batch transfers possible without the need for a wrapper contract, as with existing token standards. This reduces gas costs when more than one token type is included in a batch transfer, as compared to single transfers with multiple transactions.\r\n\r\nAnother advantage of standardized batch transfers is the ability for a smart contract to respond to the batch transfer in a single operation using `onERC1155BatchReceived`.\r\n\r\nIt is RECOMMENDED that clients and wallets sort the token IDs and associated values (in ascending order) when posting a batch transfer, as some ERC-1155 implementations offer significant gas cost savings when IDs are sorted. See [Horizon Games - Multi-Token Standard](https://github.com/horizon-games/multi-token-standard) \"packed balance\" implementation for an example of this.\r\n\r\n### Batch Balance\r\n\r\nThe `balanceOfBatch` function allows clients to retrieve balances of multiple owners and token IDs with a single call.\r\n\r\n### Enumerating from events\r\n\r\nIn order to keep storage requirements light for contracts implementing ERC-1155, enumeration (discovering the IDs and values of tokens) must be done using event logs. It is RECOMMENDED that clients such as exchanges and blockchain explorers maintain a local database containing the token ID, Supply, and URI at the minimum. This can be built from each TransferSingle, TransferBatch, and URI event, starting from the block the smart contract was deployed until the latest block.\r\n\r\nERC-1155 contracts must therefore carefully emit `TransferSingle` or `TransferBatch` events in any instance where tokens are created, minted, transferred or destroyed.\r\n\r\n### Non-Fungible Tokens\r\n\r\nThe following strategies are examples of how you MAY mix fungible and non-fungible tokens together in the same contract. The standard does NOT mandate how an implementation must do this. \r\n\r\n##### Split ID bits\r\n\r\nThe top 128 bits of the uint256 `_id` parameter in any ERC-1155 function MAY represent the base token ID, while the bottom 128 bits MAY represent the index of the non-fungible to make it unique.\r\n\r\nNon-fungible tokens can be interacted with using an index based accessor into the contract/token data set. Therefore to access a particular token set within a mixed data contract and a particular non-fungible within that set, `_id` could be passed as `<uint128: base token id><uint128: index of non-fungible>`.\r\n\r\nTo identify a non-fungible set/category as a whole (or a fungible) you COULD just pass in the base id via the `_id` argument as `<uint128: base token id><uint128: zero>`. If your implementation uses this technique this naturally means the index of a non-fungible SHOULD be 1-based.\r\n\r\nInside the contract code the two pieces of data needed to access the individual non-fungible can be extracted with uint128(~0) and the same mask shifted by 128.\r\n\r\n```solidity\r\nuint256 baseTokenNFT = 12345 << 128;\r\nuint128 indexNFT = 50;\r\n\r\nuint256 baseTokenFT = 54321 << 128;\r\n\r\nbalanceOf(baseTokenNFT, msg.sender); // Get balance of the base token for non-fungible set 12345 (this MAY be used to get balance of the user for all of this token set if the implementation wishes as a convenience).\r\nbalanceOf(baseTokenNFT + indexNFT, msg.sender); // Get balance of the token at index 50 for non-fungible set 12345 (should be 1 if user owns the individual non-fungible token or 0 if they do not).\r\nbalanceOf(baseTokenFT, msg.sender); // Get balance of the fungible base token 54321.\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote that 128 is an arbitrary number, an implementation MAY choose how they would like this split to occur as suitable for their use case. An observer of the contract would simply see events showing balance transfers and mints happening and MAY track the balances using that information alone.\r\nFor an observer to be able to determine type (non-fungible or fungible) from an ID alone they would have to know the split ID bits format on a implementation by implementation basis.\r\n\r\nThe [ERC-1155 Reference Implementation](https://github.com/enjin/erc-1155) is an example of the split ID bits strategy.\r\n\r\n##### Natural Non-Fungible tokens\r\n\r\nAnother simple way to represent non-fungibles is to allow a maximum value of 1 for each non-fungible token. This would naturally mirror the real world, where unique items have a quantity of 1 and fungible items have a quantity greater than 1.\r\n\r\n## References\r\n\r\n**Standards**\r\n- [ERC-721 Non-Fungible Token Standard](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-721)\r\n- [ERC-165 Standard Interface Detection](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-165)\r\n- [ERC-1538 Transparent Contract Standard](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1538)\r\n- [JSON Schema](https://json-schema.org/)\r\n- [RFC 2119 Key words for use in RFCs to Indicate Requirement Levels](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2119.txt)\r\n\r\n**Implementations**\r\n- [ERC-1155 Reference Implementation](https://github.com/enjin/erc-1155)\r\n- [Horizon Games - Multi-Token Standard](https://github.com/horizon-games/multi-token-standard)\r\n- [Enjin Coin](https://enjincoin.io) ([GitHub](https://github.com/enjin))\r\n- [The Sandbox - Dual ERC-1155/721 Contract](https://github.com/pixowl/thesandbox-contracts/tree/master/src/Asset)\r\n\r\n**Articles & Discussions**\r\n- [Github - Original Discussion Thread](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/1155)\r\n- [ERC-1155 - The Crypto Item Standard](https://blog.enjincoin.io/erc-1155-the-crypto-item-standard-ac9cf1c5a226)\r\n- [Here Be Dragons - Going Beyond ERC-20 and ERC-721 To Reduce Gas Cost by ~80%](https://medium.com/horizongames/going-beyond-erc20-and-erc721-9acebd4ff6ef)\r\n- [Blockonomi - Ethereum ERC-1155 Token Perfect for Online Games, Possibly More](https://blockonomi.com/erc1155-gaming-token/)\r\n- [Beyond Gaming - Exploring the Utility of ERC-1155 Token Standard!](https://blockgeeks.com/erc-1155-token/)\r\n- [ERC-1155: A new standard for The Sandbox](https://medium.com/sandbox-game/erc-1155-a-new-standard-for-the-sandbox-c95ee1e45072)\r\n\r\n## Copyright\r\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).",

    "body": "\"I hope you didn't announce this like \"Biggest innovation in the manking\". 5480196 gas is unacceptably high.\"\r\n\r\nI think you need to look at the gas cost relative to the alternatives and how this differs from them. If you average this down (even without the fungible transfers that went with it) the above transfer cost ~55K per NFT sent, which compared to many other ERC721 implementations for eg. (seeing numbers 250K+ each) this offers significant savings. A simple ETH transfer costs 21K and ERC20 tokens look to cost anywhere from 35k to 130k each tx after some quick explorer checks in the top 100. So I would say the above cost is quite reasonable.\r\n\r\nOn top of that there is also the reduction of number of contracts necessary to be deployed to the network, the transaction numbers being reduced (in this case 102 : 1) and also the possible features this would bring that wouldn't be possible with separate contracts and incompatible NFT & FT standards.",

    "body": "I don't have strong opinions yet, but did y'all explore the option of composing ERC721 and 20/721 to get similar functionality? As in, creating a `AllItems` contract that is 721 but fully controlled by whatever governance mechanism you'd prefer. Then, owners can create a new item set like `createNonFungible(...)` to deploy a 721 contract and add that new contract address as one of the tokens tracked by the contract (owned by the `AllItems` contract itself). Similar for fungible assets. Then clients can get the set of all items via iterating the 721 interface, ERC165 detect fungibility or non-fungibility, and either 1) directly interface with those sub-contracts to manage their items or 2) you could provide similar `multi-send` features by proxying transfer requests through the `AllItems` contract that's either an approved operator of the sub-contract or is just an all-seeing authority (deferring the access-control logic to the `AllItems` contract to verify who owns what before transferring).\r\n\r\nAnyway, it might be a little roundabout, but it _does_ avoid the creation of a new standard by extending and composing existing ones, which is neat.",

    "body": "Hi @shrugs while not getting too far into the implementation details of a system that uses this standard, in the above example where two different fungible types and one non-fungible set were operated on what a user/creator could do is call a \"deployERCAdapter\" function on the particular type if they so wish which will deploy an adapter contract that is either fully ERC721 or ERC20 compatible depending on the base type. This means the individual set is now backwards compatible with those standards and can therefore be used in any current system that supports them.\r\nSo we get the best of both worlds, full compatibility with ERC20 and ERC721 (as an option) but also the ability to mix these two standards together by operating at the 1155 \"main level\" and so can transfer/operate on these together and on multiple of the types, in the same transaction.\r\n\r\nExtending ERC721 rather than making a new standard that can mix different fungibility (and then supporting ERC721 with backwards compatibility) wouldn't have quite worked as ERC721 mandatory standard has certain functions that only make it suitable for a single data set in a single contract such as \"balanceOf(address _owner)\" and \"isApprovedForAll(address _owner, address _operator)\" for example.",

    "body": "I mentioned that above as well, perhaps I wasn't clear enough; you can implement multi-send functionality by making the `AllItems` contract a designated operator (or a super user of sorts) for transferring tokens/items and then implement access control at the `AllItems` layer, allowing you to skip approvals and send multiple items with a single transaction exactly as you do in 1155. Nothing has changed here.\r\n\r\nI agree that composability does come with gas costs, and these should be measured. You can also separate logic and data using proxy patterns and cut down on duplicate logic deployments. (and before someone references the parity wallet, this is very much the same approach that 1155 uses by consolidating the logic and data into a single contract; it's still a single point of failure if there is a show-stopping bug).",

The only unknown is the gas implications, which could be measured. Having your sub-items be compatible with 20/721 by default is a very powerful effect. We've only just started the whole NFT thing, and fracturing into another standard instead of leveraging existing ones isn't really a strong move, imo. Existing indexers (Toshi, Trust Wallet, etc) would need to have extra logic to monitor this standard as well. And deploying ERC adaptors for every token just gets you back to the point I'm making; it should just be compatible with the existing standard by default.\r\n\r\nAnyway, give it a think and see if it solves the problem you're interested in solving. I'm very familiar with the space and the problems you're facing, specifically around gaming, and have thought about this at length as well. A next step would be profiling the gas costs of a composable approach, which I may mind time to do within the next week or two, but can't guarantee.",

It's a special case of `transferFrom()` and is less explicit, which isn't great.\r\n\r\n2. Add `safeTransferFrom(...)` instead of passing data in second 128 bits. Explicit > implicit should be favored in standards imo. \r\n\r\n3. Change arguments order of transferFrom(uint256[] _itemId, address[] _from, address[] _to, uint256[] _value)nt ordering from `transferFrom(uint256[] _itemId, address[] _from, address[] _to, uint256[] _value)` to `transferFrom(address[] _from, address[] _to, uint256[] _itemId, uint256[] _value)` which seems more consistent with current standards. \r\n\r\n4. Change the current approval logic to something like `setApprovalForAll()` or `setOperator()` instead of using specific approvals. Approvals are almost exclusively used to give access to your tokens to a trusted/vetted contract. I have yet to see an example of a specific approval value. Even with erc-721, I have yet to see a use case where giving approval to a single ID is useful. \r\n\r\nWhen it comes to `transfer()` and `transferFrom()`, is the reason for \"not\" throwing and return a bool instead to prevent a single transfer from breaking the entire transfer? What does it mean to return false? That at least one of them was unsuccessful? All of them? Not sure I understand the logic here and would love some extra info.",

    "body": "Thanks for putting this together! \r\n\r\nA few folks (@petejkim (Cipher/Toshi), @lsankar4033 (PepeDapp), @pkieltyka (Horizon Games), and myself (Rare Bits/Fan Bits)) were actually bouncing around a Semi Fungible Token standard that may make sense to combine efforts on given the similarities. I've put it below for posterity. That being said, a couple ideological things that may be worth considering:\r\n\r\n1. ERC721 was just approved after a lot of deliberation and it seems like maintaining this as an evolution/superset of ERC721/ERC20 in terms of nomenclature / API compatibility will help with adoption / building to consensus quickly. We took the approach of starting with the ERC721 spec and then evolving from there to ensure we captured all of the hard work and thought that went into that standard.\r\n\r\n2. This is bigger than games and the ecosystem for NFTs is already spreading well beyond virtual items. Switching from Items to Tokens doesn't make a whole lot of sense given the existing ecosystem that exists around these standards already. \r\n\r\n3.

What first springs to mind however is that your proposal standard does not allow for approving/transferring etc. on multiple things in one shot as they do not take array arguments.\r\n\r\nAlso the functions such as @PhABC is talking about like totalOwners sound immediately to me like they would need more storage and so gas costs to maintain. I would advocate for as little as possible on chain storage and this sort of \"metadata\" instead recorded off-chain. \r\nYou could find the owners/track balance via transfer log events for eg. and store that info elsewhere. It isn't necessary for the users to have that info stored and the developers can get this info from a local node.\r\nThe less we bloat ETH while providing great features for the users the better imho.",

This looks like a similar solution I came up with to solve this. <p>A standard will encourage the creation of tools and potentially wallets will that can deal with this paradigm.

That being said, I wouldn't be surprised if that function is mostly called with a single type. Perhaps it makes sense to implement that as a new function (`multiTransfer`) to reduce complexity for the most basic use case of transfer. If I were to vote right now, i'd say stick with the current version (one func `transfer` that takes multiple types) but wanted to raise the topic of two funcs to be diligent.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
