Because if you don't I don't see the need to have a single contract awarding a lot of trophies.\r\n\r\nIf 1 smart contract = 1 trophy and someone has the need to award multiple trophies nothing is preventing to create a \"Trophy Factory\" that creates multiple instances of a single trophy contract.\r\n\r\nBut for sure what you said needs to be kept in consideration, for now, I just wait for other opinions from the community hoping that someone else already drafted something similar!\r\n",

    "body": "I'm not sure you should be using the EIP process for asking questions like this, perhaps stack exchange (ethereum.stackexchange.com).\r\n\r\nYou could use 721 or 1155 for something like this just fine and after creating your \"trophy\" just set a uri that points to off-chain storage for all of that you want to set, even just use the uri as the storage, it's just a string you can put whatever you want in it. Or you could have a function specific to your use case to set the metadata pieces you want like winner explicitly under a struct as @thekrol01 says.\r\n\r\nIf you don't use something (like 721) that is likely to be more in use than your particular case and only offers specific features then I think it will be hard to find wallets etc. to display your items for your users personally.\r\n\r\nPerhaps this is better reformulated into instead of what standard can you have for a contract, what standard can you have for the metadata the uri points to. A proposal around this seemed to be started here #1047.",

Now I have two options: \r\n\r\n- Storing data on a struct inside the contract\r\n\r\n- Storing data off-chain on something like ipfs\r\n \r\nIn both cases whoever wants to create an interface to interact with trophies has to implement a system to interact with the new variables. \r\n\r\nMy only concern here is if I have to think for the community or just for my particular case, if I had to think just for my case I would save the data inside a struct in the contract because I have just one trophy and thus no 'minting costs'.\r\n\r\nFor the community, it's probably better to use an external JSON file because it's likely that someone will need to mint multiple trophies, and this would keep the cost lower.\r\n\r\nProbably implementing both ways is my best option.\r\n\r\nWhat would you do if you were in my position? \r\n\r\nAnother question, why I shouldn't have asked this here but on StackExchange?",
