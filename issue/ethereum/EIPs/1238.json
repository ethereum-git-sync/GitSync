Badges can be accumulated through time and put at stake. Simply speaking, badges are statements about a public key, they can be quantitative (e.g. reputation, experience) or qualitative (badges, titles).\r\n\r\n## Abstract\r\nThe *Non-transferrable token* standard defines a set of standard APIs allowing the identification of statements (called *badges*) attributed to a public key, such that different dapps and smart contract can use to filter users or to provide user with different badges different experiences. More importantly, this standard defines a way for which users can put their badges at stake. Badges cannot be transferred but can be lost (after staking) or can expire.\r\n\r\n## Motivation\r\nThe inspiration for designing badges comes from a conversation with Andrew Miller. The idea is to have a token that once assigned it cannot be transferred (like reputation) and that it can be used by websites, or contracts to make me perform some actions. For example, if a user accumulates paper submissions at conferences, then they can use their paper badges to request grants. It's important that they can never share these badges.\r\n\r\nThis is the equivalent of a variety of other use cases\r\n- Accumulating badges: degrees from academic institutions, paper publications for conferences, badges that allow for access in a building or in a special chat.\r\n- Experience points: points accumulated in a game, points accumulated by being honest in a decentralized system for some time\r\n- Statements: more broadly, any statement that is issued or signed by a contract, a dao, a single user that requires to be on-chain\r\n- Subscription: badges can represent the validity of a paid subscription\r\n\r\n## Requirements for specification\r\n- **Quantity**: a badge can have the form of 1-many, meaning that a badge can represent a single value (Degree from CS, 1), or can a quantity (Experience in Fortnite, 2000)\r\n- **Stake**: it should be simple to put at stake contingent on a smart contract execution (however, it is understandable that this could be done by a different standard)\r\n- **Backwards compatibility**: This standard should have similar apis to existing standards (e.g. #20, #721), I makes sense for an NFT viewer to also view badges\r\n- **Off-chain tokens**: This specification should work also for tokens that are not issued on chain (say by a third party signer) and can be presented on chain only when necessary (it's understandable that this is an edge case and could fall off the spec, but it's an interesting one!)\r\n\r\n## Next steps\r\nThere are two main steps here:\r\n- Specification\r\n- Implementation\r\n\r\nHowever, I will have very little time to actually bring this to life. It would be awesome if any contributor here feels strong and empowered to take over this standard and make this their own. I started this while thinking on a fun project for academia (namely called [research coin](https://nicola.io/research-coin/2017)), maybe someone wants to help there!",

    "body": "@vongohren A significant difference between #735 claims and #1238 badges is information ownership. In #735 the Claim Holder owns any claims made about themselves. The problem with this is that there is no way for a Claim Issuer to revoke or alter a claim once it has been issued. While #735 does specify a `removeClaim` method, a malicious implementation could simply ignore that method call, because _they own the claim_.\r\n\r\nImagine that SafeEmploy™, a background checking company, issues a claim about Timmy. The claim states that Timmy has never been convicted of any felonies. Timmy makes some bad decisions, and now that claim is no longer true. SafeEmploy™ executes `removeClaim`, but Timmy's #735 contract just ignores it, because Timmy wants to stay employed (and is crypto-clever).\r\n\r\n#1238 badges do not have this problem. Ownership of a badge/claim is entirely determined by the contract **issuing** the badges, not the one **receiving** them. The issuer is free to remove or change those badges as they see fit. ",

If the major org with first mover advantage creates its own version of crypto-TSA, other groups will simply save time and resources, piggybacking on what's available.\r\n> \r\n> If the problem isn't already blatantly obvious, think about the reputation bottleneck this causes: the major org or orgs that work as a crypto-TSA become gatekeepers for the whole system. We know from history that some things we do aren't the best, but they stuck because they were the most comfortable. When going from a reputation-less system into a reputation-based system, whatever comes first is most likely to stay. \r\n\r\nOn a trustless network every address should be no different from any other. I think a measured reputation system goes against what crypto should be. In other words, creating an issued-reputation ERC is opening Pandora's Box.",

    "body": "I think this is an interesting idea. It's definitely related to the concept of _claims_, but I can see an interoperability advantage in defining the behavior of these \"claims\" in a contract specific to the claim \"type\" (i.e. badge), instead of residing in the claim holder or issuer contracts (similar to how ERC20 and ERC721 work).\r\n\r\nWith regard to not limiting badge ownership to a single address, that's where we start getting into _identity_ territory, which is not a trivial one. I came across [this proposal](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/1495) recently, perhaps you guys might be interested in having a look at it and it would be good to know your feedback on the matter.\r\n\r\nOne question about defining this as a standard: should badge issuers be able to arbitrarily revoke the badge? Or would this stay outside the scope of a standard and be more a matter of particular implementation?",

    "body": "@OFRBG You are right about the danger of Reputation, but as you mentioned, the implementation plays a big role.All or null transfer-ability as suggested by @MicahZoltu still seems the best possible option.\r\nAlso, the two main preferable  implementation I believe are (I am using `claim` t refer to both `claims`  #735 and `badges` #1238),\r\n- Claim registry contract which allows contract owner create claims on address which can be approved or rejected by the address owner. The state of the contract concerning the claim can be regarded as final, as the contract gets more approved claimed, it reputation increases, and that is when things can get interesting\r\n- Claimant makes a claim on an address, which is approved by the address by publishing the claim identifier (needs a standard). The claimant can at any time withdraw the claim and the address can at any time have the claim identifier information unpublished, thereby voiding the claim. In this case, both Claimant (contract) and address (Identity contract #725 ) both have to publish the same information to be considered approved- This is a whole lot more complicated, but I think quenches mot of the worries attached to the security concerns.\r\n",

    "body": "I was thinking of a use-case for a non-transferable token for the purposes of a founders token, where tokens are bound to the user account, and the user can use the tokens for voting, private access to the platform (like beta testing) and spending/burning to redeem a benefit, but cannot trade or transfer the token, which would make a founders token sale (FTO) exempt from securities regulation as the token cannot be traded, yet would enable there to be a development fund through a token sale.\r\n\r\nThe concept comes from many traditional industries that sell a product before it’s been developed, like a founder’s or limited edition and preorder. They are able to do this because these sales cannot be transferred and is essentially a purchase rather than an investment. And in the case of non-transferable tokens with utility, you can effectively conduct a sale of tokens as an exclusive feature or benefits that cannot be traded therefore not considered an investment.\r\n\r\nCreating such a token will have tremendous potential for ICOs (designated as a FTO) to be conducted for development funding that won’t be deemed a security. It could completely change the way startups get seed funding without the limitations of an investment deal.",

    "body": "I think that it is sufficient to provide a single method that returns boolean value indicating transferrability of a token. All other details should be left to implementers. Such interface will be compatible with ERC20, ERC721, ERC1155 and other token standards.\r\n\r\nHere's an example:\r\n\r\n```js\r\ncontract ERC1238 is ERC165 {\r\n\r\n    bool internal _transfersEnabled;\r\n\r\n    /*\r\n     *     bytes4(keccak256('transfersEnabled()')) == 0xbef97c87\r\n     */\r\n    bytes4 private constant _INTERFACE_ID_ERC1238 = 0xbef97c87;\r\n\r\n    constructor () public {\r\n        _registerInterface(_INTERFACE_ID_ERC1238);\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    function transfersEnabled() external view returns (bool) {\r\n        return _transfersEnabled;\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe name `trasfersEnabled` is borrowed from [MiniMe token contract](https://github.com/Giveth/minime/blob/master/contracts/MiniMeToken.sol#L81). It is also used by [Aragon](https://github.com/aragon/aragon-apps/blob/shared-minime-v1.0.2/shared/minime/contracts/MiniMeToken.sol#L101) to designate non-transerrable reputation and membership tokens in DAOs.\r\n\r\nTransferrability of ERC1238 token can change depending on some condition, so it allows complex logic like the \"all or none\" scheme described earlier in this thread.\r\n",

    "body": "I am not sure how viable this contract can be, but having in mind potential future use-cases, I assume it should be abuse-proof. For example, We create a biometric web3 ID by completing a DNA sequencing, we upload this data to a bioinformatics related blockchain like Zenome, ARNA, or Encrypgen. The respective DLT platform could mint NTTs based on a KYC procedure that includes the genomic data. This NTT could be used as a web3 ID, and it can also be used to retrieve a wallet in case of loss of all recovery methods including private key and seed phrase. Eg. I lost my web3 wallet that has a biometric NTT, I perform a new test or request my test from the lab, or blockchain that created the initial contract using real-time KYC. Proving our new or retrieved DNA test, we could retrieve our wallet, again, considering the ERC is secure and truly nontransferable. That for, if once I mint my own biometric ID and manage to transfer it to your wallet, I could easily create a second test to claim access to your wallet that will basically indicate it bears my DNA. NTT must be obsolete. It's nice to have NTTs with expiration data, but biometric IDs could be only one time mint, one time transfer, nonfungible, and not transferable tokens. That's one of the most exciting ERCs and its a shame DeFi dudes are not paying attention. ",

    "body": "Partly inspired by this issue, @arcalinea and I are working on a reputation service that uses non-transferrable, non-fungible tokens as on-chain proofs of reputation. The token, which we call a “badge”, gets issued to an address that a user wants to link to a centralized service (i.e. Twitter, Github), through our third-party reputation verification service.\r\n\r\nWe are still playing with this concept, and have created a contract issuing these badges to the [Kovan testnet.](https://kovan.etherscan.io/address/0xb3e404E8BCbc2af1683da73f14A558662346119F) Any feedback is welcome!\r\n\r\nAt first, we drafted a version that is ERC-721 compliant, but that adds unnecessary overhead to the simple concept of a badge, which does not need approve and transfer functions, or a tokenURI field with associated metadata. The badge contract we have deployed has different requirements. These are the basic things we believe a badge contract implementation needs to have:\r\n\r\n- non-transferability of the token\r\n- a clear link to the issuer of the badge\r\n- a “burn” function to revoke badges\r\n- a timestamp at time of issuance\r\n\r\nIf this type of token becomes useful for applications, it would be great to standardize non-transferrable, non-fungible tokens.\r\n\r\nSome contract code is below. The version below does not have a token struct with id and timestamp - doing so makes querying for the time the badge was created easier, but costs more in gas.

    "body": "> I like the idea of badges, but I think it's a mistake to tie them to a single address. Over time people will have multiple accounts, and making them non-transferrable will discourage people from switching to a more secure account (eg, from a software wallet to a hardware one).\r\n\r\nI think they should be tied to a single address. The actions of each address represent a persona which is a subset of a person's identity. Whatever actions you decide to do with that wallet (buying, selling, borrowing, etc) can be rated by another wallet. So if you build a persona with a single wallet, you can now use the social credit that has been issued to this wallet through NTTs to do trusted actions like borrowing money or selling physical assets through an online marketplace. \r\n\r\nIf you switch wallets, you have to build up these NTTs on your new wallet. That's a feature. Banks and governments can issue NTTs against your wallet that represents your identity.
