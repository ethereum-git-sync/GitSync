It was then replaced by #744. ERC20 is pretty solid, and implementation isn't standard. You put anything inside the template as long as it complies with the standard.\r\n\r\nOn https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-20.md, `totalSupply` is defined as\r\n\r\n> totalSupply\r\n> Returns the total token supply.\r\n\r\nSo you have room for interpretation.",
