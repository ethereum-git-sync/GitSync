  "body": "# Title\n\n```\nTitle: Add RFC 7693 compression function `F` contract\nAuthor: Tjaden Hess <tah83@cornell.edu>\nStatus: Draft\nType: Standard Track\nLayer: Consensus (hard-fork)\nCreated 2016-10-04\n```\n# Abstract\n\nThis EIP introduces a new precompiled contract which implements the compression function `F`  used in the BLAKE2b cryptographic hashing algorithm, for the purpose of allowing interoperability between the Zcash blockchain and the EVM, and introducing more flexible cryptographic hash primitives to the EVM.\n# Parameters\n- `METROPOLIS_FORK_BLKNUM`: TBD\n- `GFROUND`: TBD\n# Specification\n\nAdds a precompile at address `0x0000....0d` which accepts [ABI encoded](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/Ethereum-Contract-ABI) arguments corresponding to the function signature \n\n```\nF(bytes32[2] h, bytes32[4] m, uint t , bool f, uint rounds) returns (bytes32[2] h_new);\n```\n\nwhere `h`, `m`, `t` and `f` are the current state, the new message, the byte counter and a finalization flag, as defined in [RFC 7693](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7693), and `rounds` is the number of rounds of mixing to perform (BLAKE2b uses 12, BLAKE2s uses 10). `h_new` is the updated state of the hash.\n\nEach operation will cost `GFROUND * rounds`.\n# Motivation\n\nBesides being a useful cryptographic hash function and SHA3 finalist, BLAKE2b allows for efficient verification of the Equihash PoW used in Zcash, making a BTC Relay - style SPV client possible on Ethereum. A single verification of an Equihash PoW verification requires 512 iterations of the hash function, making verification of Zcash block headers prohibitively expensive if a Solidity implementation of BLAKE2b is used.\n\nThe BLAKE2b algorithm is highly optimized for 64-bit CPUs, and is faster than MD5 on modern processors.\n\nInteroperability with Zcash could enable contracts like trustless atomic swaps between the chains, which could provide a much needed aspect of privacy to the very public Ethereum blockchain.\n# Rationale\n\nThe most frequent concern with EIPs of this type is that the addition of specific functions at the protocol level is an infringement on Ethereum's \"featureless\" design. It is true that a more elegant solution to the issue is to simply improve the scalability characteristics of the network so as to make calculating functions requiring millions of gas practical for everyday use. In the meantime, however, I believe that certain operations are worth subsidising via precompiled contracts and there is significant precedent for this, most notably the inclusion of the SHA256 prcompiled contract, which is included largely to allow inter-operation with the Bitcoin blockchain.\n\nAdditionally, BLAKE2b is an excellent candidate for precompilation because of the extremely asymetric efficiency which it exhibits. BLAKE2b is heavily optimized for modern 64-bit CPUs, specifically utilizing 24 and 63-bit rotations to allow parallelism through SIMD instructions and little-endian arithmetic. These characteristics provide exceptional speed on native CPUs: 3.08 cycles per byte, or 1 gibibyte per second on an Intel i5.\n\nIn contrast, the big-endian 32 byte semantics of the EVM are not conducive to efficient implementation of BLAKE2, and thus the gas cost associated with computing the hash on the EVM is disproportionate to the true cost of computing the function natively.\n\nImplementation of only the core `F` compression function allows substantial flexibility and extensibility while keeping changes at the protocol level to a minimum. This will allow functions like tree hashing, incremental hashing, and keyed, salted, and personalized hashing as well as variable length digests, none of which are currently available on the EVM.\n\nThere is very little risk of breaking backwards-compatibility with this EIP, the sole issue being if someone were to build a contract relying on the address at `0x000....0000d` being empty. Te likelihood of this is low, and should specific instances arise, the address could be chosen to be any arbitrary value, with negligible risk of collision.\n",

    "body": "In the earlier EIP about a precompiled full BLAKE2b, the following conversation happened about gas costs:\n- I suggested that [BLAKE2b's gas costs should be about ½ or ⅓](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/129#issuecomment-249766568) of SHA3's gas costs.\n- Zaki said [gas costs should be identical](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/129#issuecomment-249946157) for things within the same order of magnitude of performance.\n- I said \"[Huh? Why?](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/129#issuecomment-249965215) I thought gas costs were supposed to be approximations of the costs (in CPU time and/or energy) to the validator.\".\n- @tjade273 posted a link to [the spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1m89CVujrQe5LAFJ8-YAUCcNK950dUzMQPMJBxRtGCqs/edit#gid=0) in which gas costs including SHA3 were initially calculated by making the proportional to the number of microseconds to perform the computation.\n- Zaki linked to a post from Vitalik, saying gas costs should be [deterministic, and within about 4X of one another](https://github.com/ewasm/design/issues/50#issuecomment-250637569).\n\nOkay, so for this new proposal — the precompiled `BLAKE2b Compression Function F`, the computational cost is _not_ a base plus a cost per byte. Instead, every invocation of this precompile has the same size input (192 bytes, not counting `t`, `f`, or `rounds`).\n\nI suggest the gas cost for invoking `BLAKE2b Compression Function F` should be 440 per invocation. That's from estimating that it will take about 440 microseconds to compute it. It is within 4X of what it would cost in gas to hash a 192-byte input with SHA3.\n\n(I still don't understand what Zaki's rationale is for making the gas cost of BLAKE2b precompile be the same as gas cost of SHA3 precompile.)\n",

Once there is no longer any \"debate\" then a PR that adds the EIP using [the template](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/eip-X.md) is the next step in the process.\r\n\r\nI believe the contributing guide was recently updated: https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs#contributing\r\n\r\nOf course, I could be totally wrong about all this as I'm just a random guy on the internet with no authority, but if I were you the above is what I would do.  :)",

    "body": "By the way, there are _two_ different motivations for why this EIP should go into Ethereum. The first (dear to my heart) is to facilitate Zcash↔Ethereum interoperation using the \"BTCRelay\" technique. Basically allowing Ethereum contracts to \"see into\" the Zcash blockchain! This is already possible, but it is very slow and expensive without this precompile.\r\n\r\nBut I want to emphasize that there is another independent reason for this EIP, which is that BLAKE2 is just a more efficient and *more widely used* hash function than SHA-3, and this EIP could allow Ethereum contracts to efficiently interoperate with data generated by the growing number of BLAKE2-using data generators out there.\r\n\r\nI was reminded of this latter fact when reading this blog post by the estimable Adam Langley [“Maybe Skip SHA-3”](https://www.imperialviolet.org/2017/05/31/skipsha3.html) and the ensuing discussions on [hackernews](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=14453622) and [reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/crypto/comments/6eg3im/maybe_skip_sha3_imperialviolet/).\r\n\r\nThere appears to be a growing consensus among cryptographers that SHA-3 is not a great fit for most purposes and is not likely to become widely used. Even the authors of SHA-3 seem to be advocating not for adoption of SHA-3, but for adoption of newer, more efficient variants of SHA-3.\r\n\r\nBut everyone agrees that BLAKE2 is efficient, secure, and widely used.\r\n\r\nBy the way, you might enjoy this nice history of hash functions:\r\n\r\nhttps://z.cash/technology/history-of-hash-function-attacks.html\r\n![screenshot 2017-06-03 at 19 30 50](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/16416064/26758156/3e89330e-4893-11e7-9ba1-8ece3c244d0a.png)",

That would remove the need for the `bool f` (`F(bytes32[2] h, bytes32[4] m, uint t , bool f, uint rounds) returns (bytes32[2] h_new);`).\r\n\r\nIt may also make sense considering to make the `rounds` part of the name too.\r\n\r\nI assume the code using this would either go for Blake2b or Blake2s and wouldn't really switch between them, it would mean cheaper execution as the number of parameters for ABI encoding is lower and uses less memory as well. The downside is of course if the `rounds` parameter is actually free to be anything based on the use case.",

It's possible to e.g. point two dynamic arrays to use the same data, or point the data-part to wrap around back to the start of the argument-field. \r\n\r\nTLDR; I'd rather not have ABI-parsing as part of consensus.
