  "body": "This EIP is being further developed as https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/pull/881\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFor some \"standard interfaces\" like the token interface ( #20 ), it is sometimes useful to query whether a contract supports the interface and if yes, which version of the interface, in order to adapt the way in which the contract is interfaced with. Specifically for #20, a version identifier has already been proposed. This proposal wants to generalize the concept of interfaces and interface versions to interface identifiers:\r\n\r\nEvery \"standard interface\" should be assigned a unique identifier (the sha3 hash of its source representation would be suitable) as a bytes32 value. Interfaces that support pseudo-introspection should provide the following methods. Note that this is especially targeted at contracts that can also provide multiple non-conflicting interfaces. This is useful if e.g. a standard token contract also allows a \"cheque\" functionality, which would have its own interface ID, or if the token does not support allowances.\r\n\r\n``` js\r\n/// @returns true iff the interface is supported\r\nfunction supportsInterface(bytes32 interfaceID) constant returns (bool);\r\n/// @returns the (main) interface ID of this contract\r\nfunction interfaceID() constant returns (bytes32);\r\n/// @returns a bit mask of the supported interfaces.\r\nfunction supportsInterfaces(bytes32[] interfaceIDs) constant returns (bytes32 r) {\r\n  if (interfaceIDs.length > 256) throw;\r\n  for (uint i = 0; i < interfaceIDs.length; i++)\r\n    if (supportsInterface(interfaceIDs[i]))\r\n      r |= bytes32(2**i);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Example implementation and usage:**\r\n\r\n``` js\r\ncontract GenericInterfaceContract {\r\n    function interfaceID() constant returns (bytes32);\r\n    function supportsInterface(bytes32 _interfaceID) constant returns (bool);\r\n    function supportsInterfaces(bytes32[] interfaceIDs) constant returns (bytes32 r) {\r\n      if (interfaceIDs.length > 256) throw;\r\n      for (uint i = 0; i < interfaceIDs.length; i++)\r\n        if (supportsInterface(interfaceIDs[i]))\r\n          r |= bytes32(2**i);\r\n    }\r\n}\r\ncontract SimpleToken is GenericInterfaceContract {\r\n    bytes32 public constant interfaceID = 0xf2a53462c853462ca86b71b97dd84af6a2f7689fc12ea917d9029117d32b9fde;\r\n    event Transfer(address indexed _from, address indexed _to, uint256 _value);\r\n\r\n    function totalSupply() constant returns (uint256 supply);\r\n    function balanceOf(address _owner) constant returns (uint256 balance);\r\n    function transfer(address _to, uint256 _value) returns (bool success);\r\n\r\n    function supportsInterface(bytes32 _interfaceID) constant returns (bool) {\r\n        return _interfaceID == interfaceID;\r\n    }\r\n}\r\ncontract Token is SimpleToken {\r\n    bytes32 public constant interfaceID = 0xa2f7689fc12ea917d9029117d32b9fdef2a53462c853462ca86b71b97dd84af6;\r\n    event Approval(address indexed _owner, address indexed _spender, uint256 _value);\r\n\r\n    function transferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 _value) returns (bool success);\r\n    function approve(address _spender, uint256 _value) returns (bool success);\r\n    function allowance(address _owner, address _spender) constant returns (uint256 remaining);\r\n\r\n    function supportsInterface(bytes32 _interfaceID) constant returns (bool) {\r\n        return _interfaceID == interfaceID || super.supportsInterface(_interfaceID);\r\n    }\r\n}\r\ncontract C {\r\n    function retrieveRemainingAllowance(GenericInterfaceContract c, address owner) returns (uint) {\r\n        if (c.supportsInterface(Token.interfaceID)) {\r\n            Token t = Token(c);\r\n            return Token(c).allowance(owner, msg.sender);\r\n        } else if (c.supportsInterface(SimpleToken.interfaceID)) {\r\n            return 0;\r\n        } else {\r\n            throw;\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Note:**\r\nSince the EVM does not provide any guarantees for the semantics of contracts, any such information returned by other contracts can only be used as a guideline.\r\n\r\n**Note2:**\r\nThe convenient access to the interface ID via `Token.interfaceID` is not yet supported by solidity ( https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/1290 ).\r\n\r\nCredits: This is the result of a discussion with @konradkonrad and @frozeman \r\n",

    "body": "Discussing this with Chris in the Solidity channel, he pointed out that an interface is more than its ABI; it's possible for two interfaces with the same set of function signatures to have different expectations of how they operate (especially since function signatures don't include parameter names!). So, the interface ID should be a pseudorandom value with low probability of colliding with any other interface ID; it doesn't need to bear a strict relationship to the source (and arguably, shouldn't, so people don't make assumptions about it being usable as some kind of test).\r\n\r\nI agree - so ignore my earlier suggestions about constructing the interface ID from the constituent functions.\r\n\r\nEdit: On the other hand, Go does 'duck typed interfaces' and generally doesn't have a problem; although you can have two interfaces with the same ABI but different intents, the chances of both of them being relevant in a given scenario seem vanishingly small. For instance, it's easy to avoid a collision in interface definitions for ENS resolvers, and nobody's going to ask an ENS resolver if it implements, say , a token-related interface.",

Something looking like this:\r\n\r\n```js\r\ncontract C {\r\n    interface I {\r\n         foo(uint256) returns (uint256);\r\n         bar(bool, string) returns (bool);\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\ncontract A {\r\n     struct MyStruct {\r\n          function foo(uint256) returns (uint256);\r\n          function bar(bool, string) returns (bool);\r\n     }\r\n     MyStruct _myStruct;\r\n     D someContract;\r\n     function a_call() {\r\n          d.f(_myStruct); //passes in _myStruct as interface to D\r\n     }\r\n}\r\n\r\ncontract B {\r\n  E _e; \r\n  D _d;\r\n\r\n  function call_D() {\r\n       _d.f(_e); //passes in E to D and thus will clear because functions align.\r\n   }\r\n} \r\n\r\ncontract E {\r\n    function foo (uint256) returns (uint256) {\r\n       //some function\r\n   }\r\n   function bar (bool, string) returns (bool) {\r\n     //some function\r\n   }\r\n} \r\ncontract D is C {\r\n     function f(_interface I) {\r\n            switch type(_interface) { //switch on the types of objects passed into the interface (i think this should be mandatory to some extent)\r\n                 case A:\r\n                      uint a = _interface.foo(1);\r\n                 case B: \r\n                       bool truth = _interface.bar(true, \"something\");\r\n                 default: throw;\r\n            }\r\n     }\r\n}\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nI'm not sure about xor-ing it...that may work, I'm just not sure I understand it yet, need to look. What I think we can do for the type assertion is to hash for these types based on their actual function opcodes that they are utilizing/generating on the stack portion. This will make it so that we can verify that only these contracts are calling externally and can make the interface quite a useful safety mechanism. ",

I see three possibilities:\r\n\r\n- The ERC-165 interface signature includes just the required methods (The sample code at the bottom of the draft spec seems to imply that this is _not_ the expected interpretation, and includes optional methods (like `symbol()`) in the signature calculation for ERC-20.)\r\n- The ERC-165 interface signature for a specific implementation includes only those optional functions that are actually implemented. This has the nice properly that you could theoretically figure out which subset of optional functionality each contract implements, but has the absolutely abysmal property that you'd have to query every possible subset of optional functionality in order to test a contract! 😬 \r\n- The ERC-165 interface signature for a specific implementation includes all optional functions. This seems a bit weird to me, because it kind of feels like promising to implement functions that you might not implement.\r\n\r\nBecause the example includes optional methods for ERC-20, I'm going to include optional methods for ERC-721. @jbaylina: Please let me know ASAP if I'm getting this wrong! :-D ",

At the very least, the guidance could be essentially what you wrote:\r\n\r\n> It may be appropriate for single interface standard can define multiple ERC-165 interface signatures to indicate \"degrees\" of implementation. It is up to each interface standard to determine the appropriate granularity of interface signatures in it's own domain. For example, you could have one interface signature for core functionality, and one signature for an implementation that adds optional functionality. If one interface is a proper superset of another interface, an implementation that supports the more encompassing standard should report support for both.",

Contract Ali wants to check if contract Bob supports Ali's favourite interface. Ali calls Bob with a standard function (the pre-known 4-byte selector for `supportsInterface`). Bob says \"no\" (`false`). Ali continues with the \"counter-party doesn't support interface\" branch of its code - e.g. emits an event and stops; or tries a different interface; or pings contract Cat as the next candidate counter-party.\r\n\r\nImagine now the `isSomethingSpecial` approach. Ali calls Bob, and that falls through to Bob's fallback (because Bob doesn't support that particular interface), which `revert`s. Ali has no way to inquire Bob if they can have a civil conversation.

If you wanted to design an interface that has the same signature as the ERC20 signature then you could do it in a reasonable amount of time.\r\n\r\nYou could then have other contract authors unwittingly implement your interface. And those contracts would test positive for your interface and for the ERC20 interface.\r\n\r\nAnyway, the algorithms are already written to do this type of attack, just look up step two of the quadratic sieve method.",
