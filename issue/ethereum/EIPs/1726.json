Track\r\ncategory: ERC\r\nstatus: Draft\r\ncreated: 2019-01-27\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Simple Summary\r\n\r\nA standard interface for dividend-paying tokens.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Abstract\r\n\r\nThe following standard allows for the implementation of a standard API for dividend-paying tokens within smart contracts.\r\nThis standard provides basic functionality to allow anyone to pay and distribute ether to all token holders.\r\nA token holder can then view or withdraw the ether distributed to them from the contract.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Motivation\r\n\r\nWhile the number of tokens and dapps with dividend paying features is growing, there is few widely adopted standard interfaces for such contracts.\r\nA standard interface allows wallet/exchange applications to work with any dividend-paying token on Ethereum, which makes it much easier to view and manage dividends from different sources.\r\n\r\nIn this EIP, we propose a standard interface and a well-tested implementation for a dividend-paying token contract.\r\nWe hope that our work could help the community to reach a consensus of the standard.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Specification\r\n\r\n```solidity\r\npragma solidity ^0.5.0;\r\n\r\n\r\n/// @title Dividend-Paying Token Interface\r\n/// @author Roger Wu (https://github.com/roger-wu)\r\n/// @dev An interface for a dividend-paying token contract.\r\ninterface DividendPayingTokenInterface {\r\n  /// @notice View the amount of dividend in wei that an address can withdraw.\r\n  /// @param _owner The address of a token holder.\r\n  /// @return The amount of dividend in wei that `_owner` can withdraw.\r\n  function dividendOf(address _owner) external view returns(uint256);\r\n\r\n  /// @notice Distributes ether to token holders as dividends.\r\n  /// @dev SHOULD distribute the paid ether to token holders as dividends.\r\n  ///  SHOULD NOT directly transfer ether to token holders in this function.\r\n  ///  MUST emit a `DividendsDistributed` event when the amount of distributed ether is greater than 0.\r\n  function distributeDividends() external payable;\r\n\r\n  /// @notice Withdraws the ether distributed to the sender.\r\n  /// @dev SHOULD transfer `dividendOf(msg.sender)` wei to `msg.sender`, and `dividendOf(msg.sender)` SHOULD be 0 after the transfer.\r\n  ///  MUST emit a `DividendWithdrawn` event if the amount of ether transferred is greater than 0.\r\n  function withdrawDividend() external;\r\n\r\n  /// @dev This event MUST emit when ether is distributed to token holders.\r\n  /// @param from The address which sends ether to this contract.\r\n  /// @param weiAmount The amount of distributed ether in wei.\r\n  event DividendsDistributed(\r\n    address indexed from,\r\n    uint256 weiAmount\r\n  );\r\n\r\n  /// @dev This event MUST emit when an address withdraws their dividend.\r\n  /// @param to The address which withdraws ether from this contract.\r\n  /// @param weiAmount The amount of withdrawn ether in wei.\r\n  event DividendWithdrawn(\r\n    address indexed to,\r\n    uint256 weiAmount\r\n  );\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nOPTIONAL functions for a dividend-paying token contract:\r\n\r\n```solidity\r\npragma solidity ^0.5.0;\r\n\r\n\r\n/// @title Dividend-Paying Token Optional Interface\r\n/// @author Roger Wu (https://github.com/roger-wu)\r\n/// @dev OPTIONAL functions for a dividend-paying token contract.\r\ninterface DividendPayingTokenOptionalInterface {\r\n  /// @notice View the amount of dividend in wei that an address can withdraw.\r\n  /// @param _owner The address of a token holder.\r\n  /// @return The amount of dividend in wei that `_owner` can withdraw.\r\n  function withdrawableDividendOf(address _owner) external view returns(uint256);\r\n\r\n  /// @notice View the amount of dividend in wei that an address has withdrawn.\r\n  /// @param _owner The address of a token holder.\r\n  /// @return The amount of dividend in wei that `_owner` has withdrawn.\r\n  function withdrawnDividendOf(address _owner) external view returns(uint256);\r\n\r\n  /// @notice View the amount of dividend in wei that an address has earned in total.\r\n  /// @dev accumulativeDividendOf(_owner) = withdrawableDividendOf(_owner) + withdrawnDividendOf(_owner)\r\n  /// @param _owner The address of a token holder.\r\n  /// @return The amount of dividend in wei that `_owner` has earned in total.\r\n  function accumulativeDividendOf(address _owner) external view returns(uint256);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Implementation\r\n\r\nOur implementation of a mintable dividend-paying ERC20 token: https://github.com/Roger-Wu/DividendPayingToken\r\n\r\n\r\n## Backwards Compatibility\r\n\r\nThe interface is designed to be compatible with ERC20 (#20) and ERC1400 (#1411) security token standard.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Copyright\r\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).",
