A name SHOULD be 50 characters or less, and unique amongst all NFTs tracked by this contract. A name MAY contain white space characters, but MUST NOT include new-line or carriage-return characters. A name MAY include a numeric component to differentiate from similar NFTs in the same contract. For example: \"Happy Token #157\".\r\n\r\n * image (optional) - If the `image` sub-path exists, it MUST contain a PNG, JPEG, or SVG image with at least 300 pixels of detail in each dimension. The image aspect ratio SHOULD be between 16:9 (landscape mode) and 2:3 (portrait mode). The image SHOULD be structured with a \"safe zone\" such that cropping the image to a maximal, central square doesn't remove any critical information. (The easiest way to meet this requirement is simply to use a 1:1 image aspect ratio.)\r\n\r\n * description (optional) - If the `description` sub-path exists, it MUST contain a UTF-8 encoded textual description of the asset. This description MAY contain multiple lines and SHOULD use a single new-line character to delimit explicit line-breaks, and two new-line characters to delimit paragraphs. The description MAY include [CommonMark](http://commonmark.org)-compatible Markdown annotations for styling. The description SHOULD be 1500 characters or less.\r\n\r\n * other metadata (optional) - A contract MAY choose to include any number of additional subpaths, where they are deemed useful. There may be future formal and informal standards for additional metadata fields independent of this standard.\r\n</details>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nThe current version of EIP-721 makes no mention of these requirements, and leaves implementers in the dark as to what are reasonable values for name and description. Is there a reason why the metadata spec is so minimal, or should an addendum be considered?\r\n",
