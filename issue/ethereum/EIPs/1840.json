    "body": "> We can theorize, but we’ll need to get actual legal advice if we want to solve this.\r\n\r\nLawyers also only theorize, they are just experts at it.  The job of a corporate lawyer is 99% trying to _guess_ how some future unknown judge would rule on some topic.  On the topic of copyright/patent lawsuits, there are actually relatively few cases that actually end up in front of a judge, so when a lawyer guesses about how a judge will rule on patents/copyrights they are largely extrapolating based on other related concepts that have made it to a judge.  Unfortunately, what is much more common than that is to just compare yourself to how everyone else does it and rely on the fact that \"Google is a bigger target, and they do X, so if we do X we will likely be overlooked by the trolls\".\r\n\r\n> Here's Bob Summerwill's suggested changes for ETC https://github.com/ethereumclassic/ECIPs/pull/162/files#\r\n\r\nThat basically says \"Satoshi Nakamoto is not allowed to contribute to this project.\"\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nThe things that I would like to see remain for Ethereum regarding licensing/patenting process:\r\n1. No attribution required.  While the vast majority of software engineers ignore the attribution clause in licenses, I would rather not have it in the first place.  CC0 is the most open license possible (on par with things like WTFPL and Unlicense) and allows the code to be used with the fewest restrictions.\r\n2. Anonymity allowed and encouraged.  We live in an age where people are forced to give up more and more privacy every day.  I would like to see Ethereum continue to push back against that rather than capitulate to it.  I would rather see patent troll companies like IBM _not_ engage with Ethereum than drive away actors like Satoshi because we were unwilling to allow people to engage privately.\r\n3. No additional work required by contributors.  It is hard enough to get people to contribute _usefully_ to EIPs.  Making them go through bureaucratic hoops like checking boxes before they are allowed to contribute doesn't encourage contributions, it only discourages them.\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nSomething I would be amenable to is the addition of a PATENT.md file in the root of this repo and linked to by the EIP template if desired.  In this file it would just assert that the contributor waives patent rights of any code they contribute and to the best of their knowledge is not aware of any patents on their contribution.",

    "body": "@erkinalp this is mainly about the spec license and also about any sample code. Spec under CC0 is fine. \n\nHaving sample code under Apache would mean that sample code is always under Apache and we’re good. \n\n@MicahZoltu I agree with most of what you’ve stated. Asserting / agreeing to a PATENTS.md might be the lightest weight thing to be done. And it’s frameable as a question - can pseudonymous contributors give up patent claims by contributing (or similar phrasing). ",
