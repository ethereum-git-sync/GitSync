There is at least one global registry (though other may create more like the global Registry) to which you can add your token. Adding your token to it would increase the experience of the user that the GUI Client can use or not.\n#### symbol\n\n``` js\nfunction setSymbol(string _s)\nfunction symbol(address _token) constant returns (string)\n```\n\nSets or returns a short sequence of letters that are used to represent the unit of the coin. When setting, it assumes the `msg.sender` is the token. Solidity string is on UTF-8 format so this should support any character supported by UTF-8. Symbols are chosen by the contract and it's up to the client to decide how to handle different currencies with similar or identical symbols.\n\nExamples or symbols: `USDX`, `BOB$`, `Ƀ`, `% of shares`.\n#### name\n\n``` js\nfunction setName(string _s)\nfunction name(address _token) constant returns (string)\n```\n\nSets or returns the name of a token. Solidity string is on UTF-8 format so this should support any character supported by UTF-8. Names are chosen by the contract and it's up to the client to decide how to handle different currencies with similar or identical names.\n\nExamples of names: `e-Dollar`, `BobToken`, `Bitcoin-Eth`.\n#### baseUnit\n\n``` js\nfunction setBaseUnit(uint _s)\nfunction baseUnit(address _token) constant returns (uint256)\n```\n\nSets or returns the base unit of a token. Although most tokens are displayed to the final user as containing decimal points, token values are unsigned integers counting in the smallest possible unit. The client should always display the total units divided by `baseUnit`. Base units can be any integer but we suggest only using powers of 10. At the moment there is no support for multiple sub-units.\n\nExample: Bob has a balance of 100000 BobTokens, whose base unit is 100. His balance will be displayed on the client as **BOB$100.00**\n\nAlso see https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/20\n",

    "body": "As I've voiced that concern before I'm vehemently against using `baseUnit` and instead think we should use `decimals`. For these reasons:\n- Decimals allow to use a lower bytes variable: uint8 will allow up to 255 decimal places. As a reference, if a unit of 1 represents the size of the observable universe, then in order to count the size of a planck length (smallest possible size physics allows) then you would need about 80 decimal places.\n- Having a division unit that is not a power of 10 would create confusion to the user. For example a baseUnit of 7 means that you can only send values that are multiples of 0.142857.. The purpose of client is to make transactions clearer to the user and representing a token transfer of 10 units as 1.42857.. is simply a misrepresentation of reality.\n- Also `baseUnit` is ambiguous with the base of the number representation (base 10, binary etc). Having a base unit of 16 does not means that a token is supposed to be represented as a hexadecimal,  just that the smallest possible divisible unit is 0.0625. The wallet would still represent it using the decimal system (while no user ever asked that, the wallet could display all numbers in binary, hexadecimal or base58 but even if did that would it make sense to do that per coin??)\n- It's how users communicate. \"Bitcoin is divisible by 8 decimal points\" is a more common and easily understandable comment than \"Bitcoin is divisible by 10000000\". Actually how many 0s did I just type? Can you tell the difference without counting the 0s in your head?\n- Contracts should never deal with either as it's just for display purposes but If for some reason a contract needs to have a conversion from baseUnit to decimals, then it's a single simple solidity command: `10**decimals`. \n",

    "body": "I'm glad to agree with @alexvandesande with those arguments. I was surprised to see baseUnit instead of the already much discussed decimals. Since this is for tokens and not yards, I think it would be much better to stick to decimals, so even in the case of an eShillings, it would be easy enough to present the decimals in their imperial glory. Same goes for time units but without the sarcasm.\n\nI think setters are very important for this standard, so contracts that register themselves don't have to implement and know which registry implements which method. Most methods in the token standard were implicitly setters (`approve()` is most obvious, but so are `transfer()` and `transferFrom()`; they all alter the state [when successful].)\n\nI also agree that both symbols and names should be `bytes32`, especially if there are issues with strings when returning values between contracts. Having a hard limit on the length of those (and using a single storage slot) also seem more sound.\n",

The moment the first registry launches people are immediately going to register (Dollar, $), (Euro, €), (Bitcoin, Ƀ) etc. So I fear that even if we have a good standard here this will still remain a problem.\n\nI guess for private and semi-private registries with access control to only approved tokens this standard will still be valuable. So the above might be out of scope for this discussion and can be deferred to when more public registries launch.\n",

    "body": "Also thought about msg.sender being the token but forgot to mention. Not only would contracts have to implement support for the registry standard, but it would mean we can't really use the Token standard until this one is also finalized...\n\nHaving to set each property separately also seems inefficient. Setting all of those in a single transaction would make a lot more sense, while allowing to pass a contract address to solve the msg.sender issue. Otherwise each setter would also need a contract parameter. In any case, setters should take a contract address and not just use `msg.sender`.\n\nProposed single-method setter:\n\n``` js\nsetToken(address _contract, bytes32 _symbol, bytes32 _name, uint256 _decimals) returns (bool success)\n```\n\nIf we do stick with separate setters, inputs should probably be more descriptive than `_s`\n\nI think there should also be methods for getting the contract address by name and symbol:\n\n``` js\ntokenByName(bytes32 _name) constant returns (address)\ntokenBySymbol(bytes32 _symbol) constant returns (address)\n```\n\n@christianlundkvist has a very good point about the economics, especially for global registries. If we agree that this standard is ok as a first-come-first-serve basis then fine, but it might not be the best standard to use for any global registry.\n",

Again supporting @caktux's setter if we must use one at all.\n",

    "body": "@frozeman No, that's what I keep saying. It's already too late to require tokens to implement this. Digix is live, the Token Standard is now set in stone and existing contracts simply can't register themselves to a global registry. Not only that, but passing a contract address doesn't change anything as to who or what can register names and symbols; you'd only prevent legitimate existing tokens from getting registered. What you're pointing out is the issue @christianlundkvist mentioned. If we want to allow changes to a registry entry, you just check `if (msg.sender == entry.contract || msg.sender == entry.creator)` where `entry.creator` was set from the initial `msg.sender`.\n\nI see your point about setters @nmushegian but I still think it should be part of the standard, so that developers won't have to call a different method for every registry they might need to use. \"Is that a Standard Token Registry? Yes, but here's the setter method for this one...\"\n",

Instead, we should expect there to be many registries, all based on their own economics. E.g. some may simply be \"first grab\", while other have intricate ways of managing fees.\n\nIf so, it means that creators of tokens will have to decide where they want to register, which can be more than one place. There will most probably be a network effect, with preferred solutions. This can be problematic from the user point of view. They will have to manage what registries they trust.Ultimately, this should be supported in a user friendly way by the UI. The same goes for exchanges.\n\nThis way would mean management of registries is completely decentralized, except for the protocol. Maybe this was already obvious to everyone except me...\n",

    "body": "Is there any updated insight to be shared on this?\r\n\r\nGiven the progress of the ENS ([EIP 162](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/162)) can we not ignore the Economics of token naming here and rather consider it from the ENS.\r\n\r\nTo clarify. A token registers a 'token-name.token' name which points to a contract implementing EIP 20. The Economics/allocation issues are handled within the name registration functionality. You can name your token whatever you like - it is essentially a 'Display name'. As such multiple tokens might be called 'Bitcoin' or 'USD', yet only one will be referred to by 'usd.token'.\r\n\r\nMy point being to attempt to focus our 'Economics brain power' to the development of a perfect ENS - abstract all the Economics to the ENS.",
