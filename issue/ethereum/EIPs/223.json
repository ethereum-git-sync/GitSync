  "body": "---\r\n\r\nERC: 223\r\nTitle: Token standard\r\nAuthor: Dexaran, dexaran@ethereumclassic.org\r\nStatus: Draft\r\nType: ERC\r\nCreated: 5-03.2017\r\nReference implementation: https://github.com/Dexaran/ERC223-token-standard\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Abstract\r\n\r\nThe following describes standard functions a token contract and contract working with specified token can implement to prevent accidentally sends of tokens to contracts and make token transactions behave like ether transactions.\r\n\r\n## Motivation\r\n\r\nHere is a description of the ERC20 token standard problem that is solved by ERC223:\r\n\r\nERC20 token standard is leading to money losses for end users. The main problem is lack of possibility to handle incoming ERC20 transactions, that were performed via `transfer` function of ERC20 token.\r\n\r\nIf you send 100 ETH to a contract that is not intended to work with Ether, then it will reject a transaction and nothing bad will happen. If you will send 100 ERC20 tokens to a contract that is not intended to work with ERC20 tokens, then it will not reject tokens because it cant recognize an incoming transaction. As the result, your tokens will get stuck at the contracts balance.\r\n\r\nHow much ERC20 tokens are currently lost (27 Dec, 2017):\r\n\r\n1. QTUM, **$1,204,273** lost. [watch on Etherscan](https://etherscan.io/address/0x9a642d6b3368ddc662CA244bAdf32cDA716005BC)\r\n\r\n2. EOS, **$1,015,131** lost. [watch on Etherscan](https://etherscan.io/address/0x86fa049857e0209aa7d9e616f7eb3b3b78ecfdb0)\r\n\r\n3. GNT, **$249,627** lost. [watch on Etherscan](https://etherscan.io/address/0xa74476443119A942dE498590Fe1f2454d7D4aC0d)\r\n\r\n4. STORJ, **$217,477** lost. [watch on Etherscan](https://etherscan.io/address/0xe41d2489571d322189246dafa5ebde1f4699f498)\r\n\r\n5. Tronix , **$201,232** lost. [watch on Etherscan](https://etherscan.io/address/0xf230b790e05390fc8295f4d3f60332c93bed42e2)\r\n\r\n6. DGD, **$151,826** lost. [watch on Etherscan](https://etherscan.io/address/0xe0b7927c4af23765cb51314a0e0521a9645f0e2a)\r\n\r\n7. OMG, **$149,941** lost. [watch on Etherscan](https://etherscan.io/address/0xd26114cd6ee289accf82350c8d8487fedb8a0c07)\r\n\r\nNOTE: These are only 8 token contracts that I know. Each Ethereum contract is a potential token trap for ERC20 tokens, thus, there are much more losses than I showed at this example.\r\n\r\nAnother disadvantages of ERC20 that ERC223 will solve: \r\n1. Lack of `transfer` handling possibility.\r\n2. Loss of tokens.\r\n3. Token-transactions should match Ethereum ideology of uniformity. When a user wants to transfer tokens, he should always call `transfer`. It doesn't matter if the user is depositing to a contract or sending to an externally owned account.\r\n\r\nThose will allow contracts to handle incoming token transactions and prevent accidentally sent tokens from being accepted by contracts (and stuck at contract's balance).\r\n\r\nFor example decentralized exchange will no more need to require users to call `approve` then call `deposit` (which is internally calling `transferFrom` to withdraw approved tokens). Token transaction will automatically be handled at the exchange contract.\r\n\r\nThe most important here is a call of `tokenReceived` when performing a transaction to a contract.\r\n\r\n## Specification\r\n\r\nToken\r\nContracts that works with tokens\r\n\r\n## Methods\r\n\r\nNOTE: An important point is that contract developers must implement `tokenReceived` if they want their contracts to work with the specified tokens.\r\n\r\nIf the receiver does not implement the `tokenReceived` function, consider the contract is not designed to work with tokens, then the transaction must fail and no tokens will be transferred. An analogy with an Ether transaction that is failing when trying to send Ether to a contract that did not implement `function() payable`.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### totalSupply\r\n\r\n```js\r\nfunction totalSupply() constant returns (uint256 totalSupply)\r\n```\r\nGet the total token supply\r\n\r\n#### name\r\n\r\n```js\r\nfunction name() constant returns (string _name)\r\n```\r\nGet the name of token\r\n\r\n#### symbol\r\n\r\n```js\r\nfunction symbol() constant returns (bytes32 _symbol)\r\n```\r\nGet the symbol of token\r\n\r\n#### decimals\r\n\r\n```js\r\nfunction decimals() constant returns (uint8 _decimals)\r\n```\r\nGet decimals of token\r\n\r\n#### standard\r\n\r\n```js\r\nfunction standard() constant returns (string _standard)\r\n```\r\nGet the standard of token contract. For some services it is important to know how to treat this particular token. If token supports ERC223 standard then it must explicitly tell that it does.\r\n\r\nThis function **MUST** return \"erc223\" for this token standard. If no \"standard()\" function is implemented in the contract then the contract must be considered to be ERC20.\r\n\r\n#### balanceOf\r\n\r\n```js\r\nfunction balanceOf(address _owner) constant returns (uint256 balance)\r\n```\r\nGet the account balance of another account with address _owner\r\n\r\n\r\n#### transfer(address, uint)\r\n\r\n```js\r\nfunction transfer(address _to, uint _value) returns (bool)\r\n```\r\n\r\nNeeded due to backwards compatibility reasons because of ERC20 transfer function doesn't have `bytes` parameter. This function must transfer tokens and invoke the function `tokenReceived(address, uint256, bytes calldata)` in `_to`, if _to is a contract. If the `tokenReceived` function is not implemented in ` _to` (receiver contract), then the transaction must fail and the transfer of tokens should be reverted.\r\n\r\n#### transfer(address, uint, bytes)\r\n\r\n```js\r\nfunction transfer(address _to, uint _value, bytes calldata _data) returns (bool)\r\n```\r\nfunction that is always called when someone wants to transfer tokens.\r\nThis function must transfer tokens and invoke the function `tokenReceived (address, uint256, bytes)` in `_to`, if _to is a contract. If the `tokenReceived` function is not implemented in ` _to` (receiver contract), then the transaction must fail and the transfer of tokens should not occur. \r\nIf `_to` is an externally owned address, then the transaction must be sent without trying to execute ` tokenReceived` in `_to`.\r\n `_data` can be attached to this token transaction and it will stay in blockchain forever (requires more gas). `_data` can be empty.\r\n\r\nNOTE: The recommended way to check whether the `_to` is a contract or an address is to assemble the code of ` _to`. If there is no code in `_to`, then this is an externally owned address, otherwise it's a contract.\r\n\r\n## Events\r\n\r\n#### Transfer\r\n\r\n```js\r\nevent Transfer(address indexed _from, address indexed _to, uint256 _value)\r\n```\r\n\r\nTriggered when tokens are transferred. Compatible with ERC20 `Transfer` event.\r\n\r\n#### TransferData\r\n\r\n```js\r\nevent TransferData(bytes _data)\r\n```\r\n\r\nTriggered when tokens are transferred and logs transaction metadata. This is implemented as a separate event to keep `Transfer(address, address, uint256)` ERC20-compatible.\r\n\r\n## Contract to work with tokens\r\n\r\n```js\r\nfunction tokenReceived(address _from, uint _value, bytes calldata _data)\r\n```\r\nA function for handling token transfers, which is called from the token contract, when a token holder sends tokens. `_from` is the address of the sender of the token,` _value` is the amount of incoming tokens, and `_data` is attached data similar to` msg.data` of Ether transactions. It works by analogy with the fallback function of Ether transactions and returns nothing.\r\n\r\nNOTE: since solidity version 0.6.0+ there is a new `reveive()` function to handle plain Ether transfers - therefore the function `tokenFallback` was renamed to `tokenReceived` to keep the token behavior more intuitive and compatible with Ether behavior.\r\n\r\nNOTE: `msg.sender` will be a token-contract inside the `tokenReceived` function. It may be important to filter which tokens are sent (by token-contract address). The token sender (the person who initiated the token transaction) will be `_from` inside the` tokenReceived` function.\r\n\r\nIMPORTANT: This function must be named `tokenReceived` and take parameters` address`, `uint256`,` bytes` to match the [function signature](https://www.4byte.directory/signatures/?bytes4_signature=0xc0ee0b8a) `0xc0ee0b8a`.\r\n\r\n## Recommended implementation\r\nThis is highly recommended implementation of ERC 223 token: https://github.com/Dexaran/ERC223-token-standard/tree/development/token/ERC223",

Allow users to deposit their tokens in contract the way simple as ether by a single transaction (i.e. `transferToContract( )` call) with no need to call `approval` than call `transferFrom`.\r\n3. Make token transactions behave same as Ether transactions.\r\n\r\n`approveAndCall` assumes that target contract will call `transferFrom` and its not like Ether transactions do. There is no need to allow target contract to withdraw tokens from someone (tx initiator). There is no need to fire `Approval` event also. From a logical point of view, we should just notify target contract that transaction appears. Also fire `Transfer` event with no approvals.",

    "body": "Well designed token contract assumes you need to trust only contract and ethereum EVM. UI level abstraction assumes you need to trust UI developers.  It also requires some things to be done by UI devs. I dont see any abstraction that is required already done. So what reason is to make a lot of requirements and dependencies between contract developers,UI developers and users when there is a way to avoid it.\r\nAt the other hand the main problem of every cryptocurrency is network bandwidth right now. Transferring of ERC20 token to the contract is a couple of two different transactions in fact. While transferring ERC23 token to a contract is a single transaction. \r\nERC20 transfer to contract also fires `Approval` event then fires `Transfer` event. Such irrational use of blockchain can cause extra bloating. ERC23 transfer fires only `Transfer` event. ",

    "body": "> In the current implementation, if a contract doesn't implement the receiver protocol, the transfer of tokens to an address that happens to be a contract will throw\r\n\r\nAs I said earlier it's done to prevent accidentally transactions of tokens to contract address where tokens will not be accessible any more.\r\nContracts are throwing accidentally ether transactions if no fallback payable function is implemented. The same mechanism for accidentally token transactions not exists so Im suggesting to implement it now.\r\n\r\n> Also I didn't know about approveAndCall, but it seems the way to go for me.\r\n\r\n`approveAndCall` may be a good thing or may be not but now it is not implemented in ERC20 and will not solve accidentally token transactions between address and contract so Im not suggesting to implement `approveAndCall`.\r\n\r\nMy proposal solves a number of problems:\r\n\r\n1. Accidentally transactions between address and contract that is not supporting this token will no longer cause a loss of tokens.\r\n2. For users: Allows not to care about contract logic of work. To transfer tokens wherever you want, you always need to call only the `transfer` function. \r\n3. For contract developers: Allows to handle incoming token transactions similar to incoming ether transaction.\r\n4. It also optimizes blockchain usage.\r\n\r\nIf you found my proposal too complex to accept, then I found this increase in complexity a reasonable price, which should be paid for preventing accidental loss of tokens in the entire future.\r\n\r\n> Also I see the problem that the receiver needs to keep a list of what tokens it supports.\r\n\r\nI don't see it is a problem but if this is the only thing that prevents the token standard from being accepted I designed a light version of contract-receiver. It will accept every incoming ERC23 token and do nothing with it. It can be called \"token-trap\" contract.\r\nYou can browse it here: https://github.com/Dexaran/ERC23-tokens/tree/light_version",

    "body": "@frozeman I would recommend to \"reject everything that is not marked as supported\" but not \"accept everything that is not marked to be rejected\" because of when contract like the dao-refund is written it shouldn't accept any of incoming token except DAO. If DAO-token is not ERC23 so there is no way to accept anything ERC23 and we should place `function tokenFallback(address _from, uint _amount) { throw; }` inside dao-refund to make every ERC23 be rejected.\r\nBut if we need to make a DAO23 refund contract to accept ERC23 standard based tokens (DAO23) we should specify DAO23 as allowed. So any other ERC23 token will still be rejected.\r\nToken standard is a recomendation to token developers how to develop their tokens in the best way. So I found it important not only recommend how tokens should be developed but also how token transactions should be handled.\r\nDo you think it is not needed to be included in token standard?",
