    "body": "\r\n# Summary of Devcon 5 EIP-1193 meeting\r\n\r\n## Participants\r\n\r\nThis is an incomplete list of people/projects that participated. Please feel free to add yourself or others: @alcuadrado, @nivida, @davidmurdoch, @joshstevens19, @adrianmcli, @iurimatias, @ricmoo, @spalladino, @javier-tarazaga, @ylv-io, and members from Alchemy, Chainsafe, Metamask, and possibly more projects. \r\n\r\n## Format of the discussion\r\n\r\nInitially, every member raised what they thought were the most important concerns to move the EIP forward. After that, we discussed most of them and proposed possible solutions.\r\n\r\n## List of concerns\r\n\r\n1. EIP-1193 began as a spec on how to expose a provider in a dapp browser, but mutated into specifying its interface. It still depends on EIPs related to browser-specific stuff.\r\n\r\n2. The way a provider is exposed (i.e. `window.ethereum`) only supports a single provider. This is in conflict with users installing multiple wallet extensions, and may be problematic with a multi-chain future.\r\n\r\n3. The current provider implementations have different interfaces (i.e. `send` vs `sendAsync`).\r\n\r\n4. There's no way to send batch requests in the current spec.\r\n\r\n5. Some providers need `open`/`connect` and `close`/`disconnect` methods, and others don't.\r\n\r\n6. How can a provider be known to be EIP-1193 compatible?\r\n\r\n7. How can this EIP be extended in the future? How are those extensions going to be detected?\r\n\r\n## Proposed solutions\r\n\r\n1. EIP-1193 will only focus on the provider's interface. How to expose in browser environments will be part of another document, possibly an RFC. Any dependency on browser-specific EIPs will be removed.\r\n\r\n2. As this EIP won't dictate how to expose the provider, this item is outside of its scope.\r\n\r\n3. Finalizing this EIP and adopting ti will fix it.\r\n\r\n4. There was a short discussion about this. We concluded that we don't know what to do yet. It may be just an issue with the UI controlling the provider. If a `sendBatch` method is needed in the future, another EIP can extend this one.\r\n\r\n5. We concluded that every provider should provide these methods (/cc @pedrouid ). It's up to the provider implementation to document if they need to be called or not. If a certain provider doesn't need them, it can implement them as `no-op`s.\r\n\r\n6 and 7. Most of the time was spent discussing these items. We considered different approaches like not doing anything at all, imposing a certain class name, and many other techniques. \r\n\r\nWhat we concluded is that providers would have a whitelist of the capabilities they offer. The most basic provider (i.e. HTTP-based provider) will have such a whitelist empty. More featureful providers will declare all of their extra features. For example, a websocket/polling-based provider that supports subscriptions, should declare that in the whitelist.\r\n\r\nWe analyzed the risk of this whitelist getting huge with time, but still decided to go with this approach. It's not clear that it will actually get huge, nor that this would even care.\r\n\r\nWe chose this approach over others, as it's more explicit and simpler.\r\n\r\n## Next steps\r\n\r\n* @pedrouid do you want to adapt https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/pull/2261 so that it includes the `open` and `close` methods as described here?\r\n\r\n* I will submit a PR removing any reference to browser-specific stuff.\r\n\r\n* I will prepare a PR with the changes proposed in 6 & 7. We can discuss the details there. \r\n\r\n(Disclaimer: I will probably do these things next week, as I have to get back to Argentina and will be super jet-lagged).",

This EIP should have a section about security concerns as well and should provide some possible solutions for doing it in a secure way. (probably MetaMask has some good inputs here for creating a RFC @danfinlay) \r\n\r\nRequired Sections:\r\n- Defining of the ``window.ethereum`` object interface \r\n  + ``window.ethereum.getProvider(..)`` -> Get provider for specific chain\r\n  + ``window.ethereum.provider`` -> Get default provider selected by the user\r\n  + ... what ever other property or method should exists on the ``window.ethereum`` object\r\n- Security ([SES](https://github.com/Agoric/SES), [Realms Shim](https://github.com/Agoric/realms-shim), [Realm Proposal](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-realms/#ecmascript-spec-proposal-for-realms-api))\r\n\r\n(we probably should have further discussion about the injection of providers in the related RFC PR)\r\n\r\n> There's no way to send batch requests in the current spec.\r\n\r\nDiscussed 2y ago [here](https://github.com/ethereum/interfaces/issues/16).\r\n\r\n> We concluded that every provider should provide these methods (/cc @pedrouid ).

We should merge #2090 which includes related changes.",

    "body": "### Regarding `open`/`close`\r\n\r\nI believe that an `open` method should be added to #2261.\r\n\r\nAs discussed, [EIP 1102](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-1102.md) has deprecated its `enable` method, and replaced it with `send('eth_requestAccounts')`. The point of this method is to do exactly what you'd expect: ask the user to expose their Ethereum account(s).\r\n\r\nIn #2261, `close` is described as: `Provider connection can be closed using this method`. I interpret this to mean that the provider will stop communicating with any Ethereum chains and possibly the wallet itself, and no longer accept any RPC requests.\r\n\r\nThe question then becomes, if you `close` a Provider connection, how do you reopen it?\r\n\r\nI don't think these methods were considered with MetaMask in mind, but I'll use us as a concrete example. In MetaMask, even if you haven't \"connected\" in the sense of [EIP 1102](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-1102.md) (i.e. exposed any accounts), you can still request a bunch of RPC methods, such as `net_version` and `eth_chainId`. In addition, you can also check if e.g. MetaMask is unlocked. If we ever implemented `close` in any non-trivial sense, there'd be no way to explicitly re-open the connection. If we re-opened the connection implicitly, e.g. on an RPC request, then I don't see the point of closing the connection in the first place.\r\n\r\nIn short, I don't believe that `close` is useful without an `open` method in EIP 1193. I created a PR against #2261 with suggested changes here: https://github.com/pedrouid/EIPs/pull/4\r\n\r\nI don't think this is the case, but if the desire is to enable the dapp to ask the user to stop exposing accounts, I believe that discussion should move to [EIP 1102](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-1102.md) or [EIP 2255](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-2255.md).\r\n\r\nTo be clear, MetaMask will support this EIP either way, and as things stand, we'll support `close` as a no-op.\r\n\r\ncc: @alcuadrado @pedrouid ",

Things will only work if the client and the provider both align.\r\n\r\nRecommended remediation: Add a method for asking the provider what version of the protocol it is running.  This could be as simple as a string, or a string array, where the string(s) represent supported protocols.\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\nversion: (): Promise<('eip-1193' | 'eip-1234')[]>\r\n```\r\nIf a given provider supports several different EIPs, then it can return each of them in the array.  The client then merely needs to check if that function exists, and if it does do a `.includes` check on the result for its preferred protocol (potentially working its way down a list).  We can start with just 2 protocols, one for `eip 1193` and one for `legacy web3`.",

    "body": "@MicahZoltu, why can't they implement both signatures?\r\n\r\nProviders can use method overloading to provide both ways.

This signature, `send(payload: JsonRpc.Request, callback?: Callback): void`, has been deprecated in favor of the signature for `send` defined in EIP-1193 and will be removed in future versions.\");\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nOr are you just worried about callers not being able to differentiate between the legacy way the new 1193 way?\r\n\r\nI don't think this EIP should be concerned too much with this level of backwards-compatibility; providers, and clients that consume these providers, should be free to decide if they want to continue to support the legacy signature and for how long (and they should log a deprecation notice before complete removal).",

    "body": "@davidmurdoch Sorry for the delay in getting back to you.  A provider can provide multiple overloads and switch on parameters (which is a terrible pattern IMO, but it does work in this case).  However, callers _cannot_ do the same thing.  All they know is that there is a `send` function, but they do not know what parameters the `send` function expects.  If the `send` function expects only `Request,Callback` and they give it `string,unknown[]` then it will fail.  If the `send` function expects only `string,unknown[]` and they give it `Request,Callback` then it will also fail.\r\n\r\nThere is currently no graceful migration from old style to new style.  This could easily be avoided with the addition of a protocol handshake or by just using different function names.  I don't see a particularly compelling argument in making the migration more painful than necessary here.",

    "body": "Method overloading is a very common feature and I personally have no issue using it in JS. I don't mind overloading to support the old style in Ganache for another year or so (likely logging a deprecation notice in the meantime, and then an obsolete notice after that).\n\nI get that it's a bit inconvenient for everyone who writes a provider to have to keep the old API around if they want to be useful, but doing so provides a sense of stability around Ethereum's client-side APIs. As a user, especially a new user, It's beyond annoying when a project changes their long established public interface in a  backwards-incompatible manner, rendering years of community documentation and examples outdated.\n\nBecause this EIP describes an API that is  exposed to clients by the browser itself, we should consider treating it with the same level of back-compat longevity that browsers do -- supporting the old signature for the foreseeable future.\n\nAll that said, I know Ganache has it easy here, as implementors  choose us and don't have to worry about the browser's/wallet's provider's API. Still, I think provider implementors should consider maintaining the old style for while.\n\nAs far as changing the method name, have any suggestions?\n\nFor the version signaling idea (handshake or `version` property or other method), I'm not sure that'd be very graceful either.",

This should always be a strong requirement for our browser-facing EIPs.\r\n2. I want to allow new apps to work on old provider if they wish, or at least allow them to fails gracefully\r\n\r\nHandshake is not strictly necessary for 1:  new application can use the new schema and simply error out on old porivder\r\n\r\nIt is necessary for 2 though, so that new apps can first check what the provider support and either support it or inform the user to use a newer version.\r\n\r\n",

    "body": "@MicahZoltu a couple of concerns make me not fond of versioning the provider API:\r\n\r\n1. the reason the back-compat issue feels like an issue to me is because this is essentially a browser API, and browser APIs, historically, don't ship breaking changes (unless they are for security reasons).\r\n2. If we do want to think of the provider API as a browser JS API, we may want to align with the design paradigms of these existing APIs. Do any browser APIs provide versioning information? If so, what mechanism do they use, and should we try to emulate that?\r\n3. providers will need to ship increasingly complicated versioning details or handshake mechanisms for every future EIP that adds a new feature (hopefully future EIPs don't need to ship any more breaking changes).\r\n\r\nTo be clear, I still don't think this EIP itself should cover the back-compat issue. I think provider implementors should just ensure their send method works both ways for the foreseeable future. Maybe we need another EIP that defines the legacy `send`, and this EIP should build on top of it? Just a thought.\r\n\r\n",
