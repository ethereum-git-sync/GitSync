    "body": "Thanks for the review. \r\n\r\nThe primary reason for the tree width is my brain seems to think in terms of Eth2 uints now. :/ I guess it is more of a why not scenario. `salt` in HKDF accepts 32 bytes due to the underlying SHA256 hash function and therefore using less just seems to be a waste (it will be padded with zeros up to 32 bytes anyway).\r\n\r\nThe main reason I can think of for BIP32 use of narrow trees is that the index is encoded in extended public and private keys and therefore large indices would waste space. These key types are of no use in this standard as a parent's private key and child index is necessary and sufficient to calculate a child key.",

RFC 7159 states:\r\n\r\n> Since software that implements IEEE 754-2008 binary64 (double precision) numbers [IEEE754] is generally available and widely used, good interoperability can be achieved by implementations that expect no more precision or range than these provide, in the sense that implementations will approximate JSON numbers within the expected precision.\r\n\r\nGiven this, and with the lack of any real use case beyond 2^32 individual accounts per seed, I'd be inclined to dial index back to be a 32-bit unsigned integer.",

    "body": "@mratsim, thanks for raising these issues. I've clarified the indexing  in the docs. The idea is that the arrays of octet-strings are flattened into a combined octet-string by concatenation.\r\n\r\nOn the topic of seed length, I made that decision based because BLS12-381 has 128 bit security. In this case it is safe to use that amount of input entropy as the seed is passed through (several) SHA256 hashes. The security only goes birthday on the other side of the hash. That said, the design principle of reusing the KeyGen from the BLS specs still holds, so I have updated the requirements to >=256 bit.",

    "body": "@CarlBeek @mcdee @mratsim @MrChico @kirk-baird \r\nHello,\r\n\r\nI'm doing some research and preparing to support ETH2 staking in our custody product. However, I read the EIP proposals and have questions about BLS key derivation implementation.\r\n\r\nThe EIP2333 proposal states:\r\n\r\n\"Based on the order of the private key subgroup of BLS12-381 and the size of the entropy utilised, more than 54% of keys generated by BIP32 would be invalid.\"\r\n\r\nI did some tests and the result matches the statement. However, currently our custody system is using BIP44 to derive keys and we want to keep it that way. By reading the entire proposal, we understand that a new key derivation method involving intermediate Lamport algorithm is recommended but we could not find a Javascript SDK for the entire derivation process. We don't want to take the risk of writing the derivation by ourselves and leads to possible token assets loss. So I was wondering what exact reason is leading to the percentage of 54% invalid key generation and how we could solve this problem without abandoning BIP. By referring to the BLS Javascript SDK as in https://github.com/herumi/bls-eth-wasm, I came up with the solution and demo code as below:\r\n\r\n1. derive from seed by BIP\r\n2. set derived key in step1 to little endian, make it as the BLS private key\r\n3. get BLS public key by the private key\r\n\r\n<img width=\"883\" alt=\"demo-code\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/20232539/93038224-fb3eeb80-f676-11ea-88ca-c51274644737.png\">\r\n\r\nAlthough I see at least one problem in this solution. Keys generated in step 2 may be the same after being set to little endian even if the original keys generated in step 1 are different. Despite this problem, Could this solution 100% solve the BIP key generation problem mentioned in the EIP proposal? Or does anyone have better solutions for us to continue to use BIP44 for key generation without implementing another derivation algorithm?\r\n\r\nI really appreciate it if anyone could help us. Thank you.",

    "body": "> By reading the entire proposal, we understand that a new key derivation method involving intermediate Lamport algorithm is recommended but we could not find a Javascript SDK for the entire derivation process. We don't want to take the risk of writing the derivation by ourselves and leads to possible token assets loss.\r\n\r\nI expect the Lodestar team will have an implementation that is Javascript-focused and that will undergo security audit at one point.\r\n\r\nI can't comment on BIP44, note that there is no demo code in attachment.",
