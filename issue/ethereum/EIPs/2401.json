  "body": "In the ERC721 specification for `safeTransferFrom` method the `@dev`description is written as: \r\n\r\n> Throws unless `msg.sender` is the current owner, an authorized\r\n    ///  operator, or the approved address for this NFT. Throws if `_from` is\r\n    ///  not the current owner. Throws if `_to` is the zero address. Throws if\r\n    ///  `_tokenId` is not a valid NFT. When transfer is complete, this function\r\n    ///  checks if `_to` is a smart contract (code size > 0). If so, it calls\r\n    ///  `onERC721Received` on `_to` and throws if the return value is not\r\n    ///  `bytes4(keccak256(\"onERC721Received(address,address,uint256,bytes)\"))`.\r\n\r\nThe way to check for if `_to` is a smart contract can result in a false result if the smart contract is in the process of deploying . Since EIP-1052 there is a better way to check if an address is a smart contract (with `codehash`). I propose the description gets updated to reflect this or change the wording that this is clear.\r\n\r\nThe 0xcert and OpenZeppelin implementations already addressed this.\r\n\r\nReferences:\r\n\r\n- https://github.com/0xcert/ethereum-erc721/pull/229\r\n- https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/916xni/how_to_pwn_fomo3d_a_beginners_guide\r\n- https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/utils/Address.sol",

So the change will not be compatible.\r\n\r\nThere's two ways to do this:\r\n\r\n1. New EIP to mention this small change (which is only compatible on EIP-1052 networks)\r\n2. Update 721 but include an errata or notes section\r\n\r\nWe have not had a problem with changing EIPs in the past if the change is non-normative (i.e. does not change the prescription) (*\\*cough\\** 165 *\\*cough\\**) but here it does. I would actually support a new EIP for this. It's brief but it's definitely a new thing.",
