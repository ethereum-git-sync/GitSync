  "body": "## Abstract\r\n\r\nThe `eth` network protocol has two ways to propagate a newly mined block: it can be broadcast to a peer in its entirety (via `NewBlock (0x07)` [in `eth/64` and prior](https://github.com/ethereum/devp2p/blob/master/caps/eth.md)) or it can be announced only (via `NewBlockHashes (0x01)`). This duality allows nodes to do the high-bandwidth broadcasting (10s-100s KB) for a logarithmic number of peers; and the low-bandwidth announcing (10s-100s B) for the remaining linear number of peers. The logarithmic broadcast is enough to reach all well connected nodes, but the linear announce is needed to get across degenerate topologies. This works well.\r\n\r\nThe `eth` protocol, however, does not have a similar dual mechanism for propagating transactions, so nodes need to rely on broadcasting (via `Transactions (0x02)`). To cater for degenerate topologies, transactions cannot be broadcast logarithmically, rather they need to be transferred linearly to all peers. With N peers, each node will transfer the same transaction N times (counting both directions), whereas 1 would be enough in a perfect world. This is a significant waste.\r\n\r\nA similar issue arises when a new network connection is made between two nodes, as they need to sync up their transaction pools, but the pool is just a soup of dangling transactions. Without a way to deduplicate transactions remotely, each node is forced to naively transfer their entire list of transactions to the other side. With pools containing thousands of transactions, a naive transfer amounts to 10s-100s MB, most of which is useless. There is no better way, however.\r\n\r\nThis EIP introduces two additional message types into the `eth` protocol (releasing a new version, `eth/65`): `NewPooledTransactionHashes (0x08)` to announce a set of transactions without their content; and `GetPooledTransactions (0x09)` to request a batch of transactions by their announced hash. This permits reducing the bandwidth used for transaction propagation from linear complexity in the number of peers to logarithmic one; and also reducing the initial transaction exchange from 10s-100s MB to `len(pool) * 32B ~= 128KB`.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/pull/2464",

    "body": "In case you find this useful, I was writing my own EIP for this and tried to collect some data for it:\r\n\r\nI picked a random hour and weighed all the transactions included in blocks from that hour. The first block was [9039541](https://blockchair.com/ethereum/block/9039541) and the last was [9039766](https://blockchair.com/ethereum/block/9039766). All the transactions from that period consumed 5348965 bytes (5.1MB). If I compress each transaction in its own message they consume a total of 3316386 bytes (3.16MB). Averaged over the hour these two block represent, that comes out to ~921 bytes/sec of transactions. \r\n\r\nBecause nodes attempt not to send transactions to nodes which have already announced that transaction, each connection between two nodes will have each transaction sent over it about once. There is the occasional race where both nodes simultaneously send the same transaction to each other but this should be rare.\r\n\r\nGeth nodes connect to up to 25 nodes, so a maxed-out geth node spends at least 921*25 -> 22.5 KB of data each second on transaction propagation. This is an under-estimate, because there is some number of transactions which are propagated and which never make it into the chain. I'm working on an estimate for how common that is.\r\n\r\nJust for fun, I looked up Google Cloud Engine's egress pricing, $0.12/GB. So, a geth node which didn't participate in transaction propagation would save ~$10/month. This EIP won't cut the required bandwidth to 0 but across all 8000 ethereum nodes in the network this change could save the network up to $80k each month.",

    "body": "@uri-bloXroute @timbeiko The proper process is to move this to Last Call and *then* start doing client implementations.  For a Core EIP:\r\n* Draft means \"looking for initial feedback and thoughts\"\r\n* Last Call means \"we think this is ready to get into clients and discuss among All Core Devs\"\r\n* Accepted (very roughly) means that \"implementations exist and the EIP is effectively immutable\"\r\n* Final means it is scheduled for inclusion in a future hard fork\r\n\r\nSadly, that process is rarely followed and people often start doing implementations of EIPs in draft form.  I suspect this is because the EIP process has historically been a bit slow and people don't want to wait for a Last Call merge before they move forward.\r\n\r\n@karalabe If you think that this EIP is \"done\" (you aren't actively iterating on it anymore) then you can submit a PR to move it into Last Call to signal to other client developers that it is ready for broader discussion and implementation attempts.",
