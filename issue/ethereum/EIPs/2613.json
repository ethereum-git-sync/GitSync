In cases where the free option is not a concern, `deadline` can simply be set to `uint(-1)`, so it should be seen as an optional parameter\r\n\r\n",

In most use cases, you give your allowance to a smart contract in such a way that only you can later initialize the `transferFrom` from your own address.\r\n\r\nI'm all for people implementing `safePermit` if they feel that this is a concern, but in order to limit the scope of what I'm trying to do here I think such alternatives should be in a different ERC",

But if they were called with staticcall they wouldn't be able to execute the permit later anyway? In the cases I can imagine, it seems like you'd want to submit the permit whenever if it is well formed so it seems a try-catch pattern would be sufficient for this use case. Or is there some scenario you can think of in which you would NOT want to submit a well-formed permit?",

An implementation can always do some tricks like storing 256 nonce-used flags in a single variable so there are 255 storage updates for every storage addition, thus greatly reducing the gas costs.",
