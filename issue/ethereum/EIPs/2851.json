  "body": "Setting this issue up to track discussions of [EIP-2844](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2844).\r\n\r\nMy first round of feedback for this:\r\n\r\nOne of the general topics that's been discussed quite a bit is if we want to restrict the algorithms and key types supported in the [JOSE registries](https://www.iana.org/assignments/jose/jose.xhtml). Often times this is done to limit the scope of code that needs to be written by various implementations which in turn should bolster interoperability. I see you've done this via recommendations, but I'd wonder if we want to restrict further usage here via explicitly not supporting certain algorithms. Is that something you think would be beneficial?\r\n\r\nNote: This next piece of feedback is based on potentially misunderstanding the paths permission aspect. I'd like to figure out more about this and then we may not need to address the comments below. Additionally, I'd like to understand the architecture of where the operations are being performed because I'm thinking I misunder\r\n\r\nAnother point that I caught quite quickly is that this EIP is looking to use DIDs to manage discoverability of keys. I'm happy to see this approach being taken further as I think it will help quite a bit. I hope it's an approach that more DApps look to use as well. With that in mind, one of the things that I wasn't sure about was how the API would be integrated with key management to perform the sign and encrypt operations. Is your current assumption that a Key Management architecture will be used within the implementation and it's the responsibility of implementers to be handle this? In general, every JOSE implementation I've looked at has made the assumption that the private key is provided in some way and it will perform the cryptographic operation when necessary. This is slightly different from what's proposed at this point though. I think we may need to think more about what the general expectation is on the implementers and the callers in terms of who's providing which data (private key), who's performing the cryptographic operations, and who's performing the structuring of the data (e.g. creating the JWE with the signed data). From there we'll likely want to take a look at the general API design to make sure it aligns with what's generally done by wallets and other DApps that would be using this API.\r\n\r\nI'm also interested to know more about why encrypt and verify were not included. I assume there's back history from the previous attempts that may further explain this. Have they already been added via other APIs or was there some other reason that they were left off?\r\n\r\nIn general though @oed, I like the direction that you're going with this and I'm curious to hear others opinions on this.\r\n",
