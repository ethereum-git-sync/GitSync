Using this mechanism will reduce interactions with blockchain to minimal for both participants, thus saving gas and improve performance.\r\n\r\n## Motivation\r\n\r\nThere are two main purposes of this EIP, one is to reduce interactions with blockchain, the second is to link Ethereum to real-world payment problems.\r\n\r\nMany small businesses want to build payment system based on blockchain but find it difficult. There are basically two ways: \r\n\r\n1. Directly pay with token. There are many wallet can receive and transfer token but transactions on Ethereum cost gas and take time to confirm.\r\n2. User lock token on payment smart contract and service provider use payment messages signed by user to release token, establishing a micropayment channel. The advantage is interactions with blockchain is reduced and the signing/verifying process is off-chain. But interact with payment contract needs service provider to build a DApp, which require resources many small businesses do not have. Even if they managed to build DApps, they are all different, not standardized. Also, user should have a wallet with DApp browser and has to learn how to use it.\r\n\r\nThis EIP helps to standardize the interactions of micropayment system, and make it possible for wallet build a universal UI in the future.\r\n\r\n## Specification\r\n\r\n```solidity\r\n\r\n/// @return Image url of this token or descriptive resources\r\nfunction iconUrl() external view returns (string memory);\r\n\r\n/// @return Issuer of this token.

When checking out, the customer signs a message with updated consumption (old consumption + consumption this time) to store and store verifies this message off chain. The shopping process loops without any blockchain involved, until the customer wants to return the card and get money back. Because the store already holds all currency, the withdraw function should be executed by token issuer (store) to return remaining deposit balance after claim. The prepayment model can easily be built into a wallet with QR-code scanning function.\r\n\r\n2. lock-release model\r\n\r\nIf we run a paid end-to-end encrypted e-mail service that accepts token as payment, we can use lock-release model. Unlike prepayment, we charge X * N token for an e-mail sent to N recipients. In this \"pay for usage\" scenario, the counting of services happens on both client and server side. The client should not trust charge amount given by server in case the it's malfunctioning or malicious. When client decide not to trust server, it stops signing messages, but some of token is taken hostage in deposit balance. To fix this problem, the withdraw function should be executed by payer account with limitation such as epoch didn't change in a month.\r\n\r\n## Rationale\r\n\r\nThis EIP targets on ERC-20 tokens due to its widespread adoption. However, this extension is designed to be compatible with other token standard.\r\n\r\nThe reason we chose to implement those functions in token contract rather than a separate record contract is as follows:\r\n- Token can transfer is more convenient and more general than interact with DApp\r\n- Token is more standardized and has better UI support\r\n- Token is equal to service, make token economy more prosperous\r\n- Remove the approve process\r\n\r\n## Backwards Compatibility\r\n\r\nThis EIP is fully backwards compatible as its implementation extends the functionality of [ERC-20](./eip-20.md).\r\n\r\n## Implementation\r\n\r\n```solidity\r\n\r\nmapping (address => StampBalance) private _depositBalance;\r\n    \r\nstruct StampBalance{\r\n    uint256 balance;\r\n    uint256 epoch;\r\n}\r\n    \r\nfunction deposit(uint256 value) override external{\r\n    require(value <= _balances[msg.sender]);\r\n    _balances[msg.sender] = _balances[msg.sender].sub(value);\r\n    _depositBalance[msg.sender].balance = _depositBalance[msg.sender].balance.add(value);\r\n    emit Deposit(msg.sender, value);\r\n}\r\n\r\nfunction withdraw(address to, uint256 value) override onlyIssuer external{\r\n    require(value <= _depositBalance[to].balance);\r\n    _depositBalance[to].balance = _depositBalance[to].balance.sub(value);\r\n    _depositBalance[to].epoch += 1;\r\n    _balances[to] = _balances[to].add(value);\r\n    emit Withdraw(to, value);\r\n}\r\n    \r\nfunction depositBalanceOf(address user) override public view returns(uint256 depositBalance, uint256 epoch){\r\n    return (_depositBalance[user].balance, _depositBalance[user].epoch);\r\n}\r\n\r\n// prepayment model\r\nfunction claim(address from, uint credit, uint epoch, bytes memory signature) override onlyIssuer external{\r\n    require(credit > 0);\r\n    require(_depositBalance[from].epoch + 1 == epoch);\r\n    require(_depositBalance[from].balance >= credit);\r\n    bytes32 message = keccak256(abi.encode(this, from, _issuer, credit, epoch));\r\n    bytes32 msgHash = prefixed(message);\r\n    require(recoverSigner(msgHash, signature) == from);\r\n    _depositBalance[from].balance = _depositBalance[from].balance.sub(credit);\r\n    _balances[_issuer] = _balances[_issuer].add(credit);\r\n    _depositBalance[from].epoch += 1;\r\n    emit Claim(from, msg.sender, credit, epoch);\r\n}\r\n\r\nfunction prefixed(bytes32 hash) internal pure returns (bytes32) {\r\n    return keccak256(abi.encode(\"\\x19Ethereum Signed Message:\\n32\", hash));\r\n}\r\n\r\nfunction recoverSigner(bytes32 message, bytes memory sig) internal pure  returns (address) {\r\n    (uint8 v, bytes32 r, bytes32 s) = splitSignature(sig);\r\n    return ecrecover(message, v, r, s);\r\n}\r\n\r\nfunction splitSignature(bytes memory sig) internal pure returns (uint8 v, bytes32 r, bytes32 s) {\r\n    require(sig.length == 65);\r\n    assembly {\r\n        r := mload(add(sig, 32))\r\n        s := mload(add(sig, 64))\r\n        v := byte(0, mload(add(sig, 96)))\r\n    }\r\n    return (v, r, s);\r\n}\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Security Considerations\r\n\r\nBy restricting claim function to issuer, there is no race condition on chain layer. However double spending problem may occur when the issuer use multiple verifiers and payer signs many payment messages simultaneously. Some of those messages may get chance to be checked valid though only the message with the largest consumption can be claimed. This problem can be fixed by introducing an echo server which accepts messages from verifiers, returns the message sequentially with largest consumption and biggest epoch number. If a verifier gets an answer different from the message he send, it updates the message from echo server as the last message it receives along with local storage of the status about this payer. Then the verifier asks the payer again for a new message.\r\n\r\n## Copyright\r\n\r\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).",
