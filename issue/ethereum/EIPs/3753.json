  "body": "## Abstract\r\nA vanilla NFT standard is proposed. In this standard, a non-fungible token stands as atomic existence and encourages layers of abstraction built on top of NFTs. Ideal for representing concepts like right, a form of abstract ownership. Such right, especially on-chain right, can then be made liquid because of this tokenization.\r\n\r\n## Rationale\r\nThe primary intention of this proposal is not to make a technical improvement to ERC721, although a new technical direction in a subsequent proposal EIP-4341 does present new technical merits, but rather to improve the conceptual clarity of NFTs, i.e., NFTs for digital collectibles, crypto-assets are specified and known by ERC721, and NFTs for abstract ownership such as rights, membership, etc. are specified and known by EIP-3754.\r\n\r\n## Use Cases\r\nAn example of applying this token to represent the right of making a function call to a contract is given [here](https://github.com/simontianx/ERC3754/blob/main/contracts/ERC3754Example.sol).\r\n\r\nAn on-chain subscription business model is also made possibe by adopting this token to represent quarterly or yearly membership (time-dependent right). An example can be fees per transaction for off-chain data via an oracle can be replaced by a long-term membership fee. Then as long as the caller has a valid EIP-3754 NFT, the consumption of data feeds is free (plus gas fees). NFTs can be transferred, so is the right of consuming data feeds. This has certain advantages over the current pay-as-you-go business model. An example can be found [here](https://github.com/simontianx/ERC3754/blob/main/contracts/OracleMembership.sol).\r\n\r\nA mid-layer can be added between NFT buyers and NFT creators with this standard. Currently, NFT creators have difficulty setting up initial prices and NFT buyers have the fear of missing out good NFTs. A mid-layer can be added between the two sides by minting ERC3754 NFTs as rights to purchase NFTs. NFT creators can presale such rights at lower prices and set the initial prices higher. For NFT buyers, buying such rights is a small commitment and can sell such rights if they do not like the NFTs minted later on. It can be best understood as a call option on an NFT. Effectively, this is a market making layer by reducing the bid-ask spread. A similar but slightly different idea can be seen in \"@0xKiwi_ designed for @uwucrewnft\". An in-house toy example can be found [here](https://github.com/simontianx/ERC3754/blob/main/contracts/NFTOption.sol).\r\n\r\nA virtual coupon can be built by this standard. Ownership of such NFTs can enjoy certain discounts over a preset period of time.\r\n\r\nAnother great illustration of this concept can be found in this [tweet](https://twitter.com/AndreCronjeTech/status/1432687892497895425) that Andre Cronje sold the naming rights to his Twitter account to FTX.",

    "body": "@abcoathup Hey Andew, thanks for the question. ERC-721 is indeed the super set to the proposed standard here. That also introduces problems in practice. I personally had experiences explaining this new way of using NFTs to people and received confusion and doubts in return, even though `URI`s are technically OPTIONAL.\r\n\r\nA simplification can reduce the concept of NFT to its core, which is a non-fungible token. It really does not have to be attached to any metadata or link to external media contents. Instead, this simplification can actually open up new possibilities on-chain by allowing layers of abstraction built on top of a non-fungible token.",

I personally had experiences explaining this new way of using NFTs to people and received confusion and doubts in return, even though `URI`s are technically OPTIONAL.\r\n\r\n@simontianx there is already ecosystem support for ERC721, and this EIP is ERC721 without the optional components.\r\nI am struggling to see the need and to see how this EIP would get ecosystem support.\r\n\r\nIn the use case described, with NFT#1 having actions ABC and NFT#2 having actions DEF, then including the actions in the metadata would appear to be worthwhile to describe how they can be used.",

    "body": "Hey @zhaochengpro , can you elaborate on kernalization? The intention of this proposal is more for marketing a new set of possibilities which would be drastically different from current use cases put up by ERC721 than for making a technical improvement. As mentioned in the first comment in this thread, a few critical use cases of NFTs are quite  conceptually inconsistent with ERC721, although can be technically achieved by ERC721. A new proposal can help improve the conceptual clarity of NFTs, i.e., NFTs for digital collectibles, crypto-assets are specified by ERC721, NFTs for abstract ownership such as rights, membership, etc. are specified by EIP-3754.\r\n\r\nThis proposal also paves the way for a subsequent proposal EIP-3782. In that proposal, vanilla NFTs are the basic unit of logographs of characters for Chinese, Korean and Japanese languages.",
