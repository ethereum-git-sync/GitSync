    "body": "TL;DR: Registries don't have the same trust/censorship resistance properties as standards because they are mutable after introduction into production systems.\r\n\r\nWhen used appropriately, EIPs should not be implemented by anyone in production until they reach final, and once they are final they should not be mutated.  Lists on the other hand do not follow this pattern as they are continually mutated even after they have reached a final state.\r\n\r\nUnlike final EIPs, a registry EIP is subject to censorship or other author malfeasance at any point in the future, after it has reached production systems.  For example, the author could decide not to include competitor product X in the registry after people have already asserted that their registry is REGISTRY-Y compatible and those implementors may have setup an automated system for maintaining synchronization with the registry.\r\n\r\nSomeone could, of course, create a competing registry in this repository that includes everything from REGISTRY-Y but also includes the censored competing product X, but now we don't have a single canonical list and instead we have multiple competing lists covering the same thing.\r\n\r\nOne can imagine some kind of federated system where anyone can create an EIP that adds an item to a list, and I would be more in favor of this.

Either the namespace is small (for example, 8 or 16 bit identifiers), in which case only a single registry is practical, and editorial control is required to portion out the namespace, or it's large (for example, string identifiers or UUIDs) in which case censorship is fairly pointless, and the registry exists to avoid accidental collisions between 'standardised' (as opposed to vendor-specific) keys.\r\n\r\nI think you're allowing the perfect to be the enemy of the good here. We don't have some hypothetical best-of-all-worlds decentralised registry system, and if the EIPs process won't allow creating or linking to a more practical registry, any EIP that depends on registries will be varying degrees of broken until then.",

    "body": "> I would really rather avoid re-building something like ENS for every list, and I'm not a fan of EIPs that just point at some censorable/closed registry, as that feels like it goes against the ethos of Ethereum to me.\r\n\r\nMy proposal (#4835), would actually be a pretty good start for this. The `canSetDomain` and `canDeleteDomain` functions could always return false, and the `canCreateDomain` could implement some sort of check on the domain that would be set. It also has the advantage that EIPs themselves can be added to a 'root' domain, for easy lookups.",
