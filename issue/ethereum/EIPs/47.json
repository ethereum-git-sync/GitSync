How to get the named values?**\n> Enums are not supported by the ABI, they are just supported by Solidity. You have to do the mapping yourself for now, we might provide some help later.\n\nEnums would actually very useful types to be exposed on the ABI, specially for auto generated interfaces on the wallet and on abi2html, for example. On the read side, properties could be exposed as words instead of meaningless integers. On the execute side, enums could be rendered as drop down or radio boxes.\n\nThis would make interface creation easier.\n",

You are right that explicit `enum` and `struct` prefixes avoid collisions (and also makes it easier to parse), but having to use `struct` at the inner level and not at the outermost level makes it a bit less elegant.\n",
