I suggest that Travis CI parse the .gitmodules file (if it exists) and skip all files contained in submodules. This would allow EIP authors to simply add the target repository in their `assets` directory instead of having to provide an external link to it (discouraged by EIP-1).\r\n\r\nThe `.gitmodules` file will be edited every time someone adds a git submodule. The bot should not fail when this file is changed.",
