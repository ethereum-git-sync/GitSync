The motivation for EIP-3754 was that it removes the `tokenURI`, `symbol`, and `name` functions from the EIP-721 spec. However, unless I misinterpreted EIP-721, all three functions are actually part of the (optional) ERC721Metadata extension. The interfaces (unless I missed something) are therefore identical.\r\n\r\nThoughts?",

Applications wouldn't be able to tell the difference between EP-3734 tokens and EIP-721 tokens (they even have the same EIP-165 identifier), so I'd argue that ERC is the wrong type for that proposal. The EIP should instead be an Informational EIP formalizing the statement that abstract ownership can be represented with EIP-721 tokens.",

    "body": "> > Abstract ownership such as rights especially on-chain rights is a type of ownership of performing functionalities such as calling a certain function or interacting with certain contracts. Other examples include on-chain membership, virtual coupons, and other options, etc.\r\n> \r\n> I'm not sure that's a meaningful differentiation. Applications wouldn't be able to tell the difference between EP-3734 tokens and EIP-721 tokens (they even have the same EIP-165 identifier), so I'd argue that ERC is the wrong type for that proposal. The EIP should instead be an Informational EIP formalizing the statement that abstract ownership can be represented with EIP-721 tokens.\r\n\r\nThe reality is although it can, no one is doing it since this capability is very much hidden. Making it explicitly written can benefit the bigger community. I think you underestimated the importance of conceptual clarity. ",
