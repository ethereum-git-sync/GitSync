The set of smart contract interfaces described in this document defines an ERC-721 extension/compatible token standard. This standard introduces an <ID, SLOT, VALUE> triple scalar model that represents the semi-fungible structure of a token. It also introduces new transfer models as well as approval models that reflect the semi-fungible nature of the tokens.\r\n\r\n## Abstract\r\n\r\nERC-3525 is an ERC-721 compatible token standard, where each ERC-3525 token, like an ER-721 token, contains an ID property to identify itself as a universally unique entity, so that the tokens can be transferred between addresses and approved to be operated in ERC-721 compatible way.\r\n\r\nERC-3525 tokens also contain an 'value' property, representing the quantitative nature of the token. The meaning of the 'value' property is quite like that of the 'balance' property of an ERC-20 token. Each ERC-3525 token has a 'slot' attribute, ensuring that the value of two ERC-3525 tokens with the same slot be treated as fungible, adding fungibility to the value property of the tokens.\r\n\r\nERC-3525 introduces new token transfer models for semi-fungibility,  including value transfer between two tokens of the same slot and value transfer from a token to an address.\r\n\r\n## Motivation\r\n\r\nTokenization is one of the most important trends by which to use and control digital assets in crypto. Traditionally, there are two approaches to do so: fungible and non-fungible tokens. Fungible tokens are generally powered by ERC-20 standard, where every unit of an asset is identical to each other. ERC-20 is a flexible and efficient way to manipulate fungible tokens. Non-fungible tokens are predominantly ERC-721 tokens, powered by a standard capable of distinguishing digital assets from one another based on identity. \r\n\r\nHowever, both have significant drawbacks. For example, ERC-20 requires that users create a separate ERC-20 contract for each individual data structure or combination of customizable properties, resulting in an unrealistic amount of ERC-20 contracts that need to be created in practice. On the other hand, ERC-721 tokens provide no quantitative feature, hence significantly undercutting their computability, liquidity, and manageability. For example, if we are to create financial instruments such as bonds, insurance policy, vesting plans using ERC-721, no standard interfaces are available for us to control the value in them, making it impossible, for example, to transfer a portion of the equity in the contract represented by the token. \r\n\r\nA more intuitive and straightforward way to solve the problem is to create a semi-fungible token that has the quantitative features of ERC-20 and qualitative attributes of ERC-721. The backwards-compatibility of such semi-fungible tokens would help utilize existing infrastructures already in use and lead to faster adoption.\r\n\r\nFor further design motivations, please view papers and documents below:\r\n\r\n**Articles & Discussions**\r\n\r\n- [How ERC-3525 can improve position management in uniswap-v3](https://solvprotocol.medium.com/how-vnft-can-improve-position-management-in-uniswap-v3-221ab49a8cb2)\r\n- [What are digital assets](https://unizon.pro/en/7632.html)\r\n- [ERC-3525 tokens vs.erc-20 vs. erc-721](https://medium.com/solv-blog/vnft-tokens-vs-erc-20-vs-erc-721-e75843053786)\r\n\r\n## Specification\r\n\r\nThe keywords \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\", \"SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\", \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"MAY\", and \"OPTIONAL\" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.\r\n\r\n**Related Standards**\r\n\r\n- [ERC-721 Non-Fungible Token Standard](./eip-721.md)\r\n- [ERC-165 Standard Interface Detection](./eip-165.md)\r\n- [JSON Schema](https://json-schema.org/)\r\n- [RFC 2119 Key words for use in RFCs to Indicate Requirement Levels](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2119.txt)\r\n\r\n**Every ERC-3525 compliant contract must implement the ERC3525, ERC721 and ERC165 interfaces**\r\n\r\n\r\n```solidity\r\npragma solidity ^0.8.0;\r\n\r\n/**\r\n * @title ERC-3525 Semi-Fungible Token Standard\r\n * @dev See https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-3525\r\n * Note: the ERC-165 identifier for this interface is 0xc97ae3d5.\r\n */\r\ninterface IERC3525 /* is IERC165, IERC721 */ {\r\n    /**\r\n     * @dev MUST emit when value of a token is transferred to another token with the same slot,\r\n     *  including zero value transfers (_value == 0) as well as transfers when tokens are created\r\n     *  (`_fromTokenId` == 0) or destroyed (`_toTokenId` == 0).\r\n     * @param _fromTokenId The token id to transfer value from\r\n     * @param _toTokenId The token id to transfer value to\r\n     * @param _value The transferred value\r\n     */\r\n    event TransferValue(uint256 indexed _fromTokenId, uint256 indexed _toTokenId, uint256 _value);\r\n\r\n    /**\r\n     * @dev MUST emit when the approval value of a token is set or changed.\r\n     * @param _tokenId The token to approve\r\n     * @param _operator The operator to approve for\r\n     * @param _value The maximum value that `_operator` is allowed to manage\r\n     */\r\n    event ApprovalValue(uint256 indexed _tokenId, address indexed _operator, uint256 _value);\r\n    \r\n    /**\r\n     * @dev MUST emit when the slot of a token is set or changed.\r\n     * @param _tokenId The token of which slot is set or changed\r\n     * @param _oldSlot The previous slot of the token\r\n     * @param _newSlot The updated slot of the token\r\n     */ \r\n    event SlotChanged(uint256 indexed _tokenId, uint256 indexed _oldSlot, uint256 indexed _newSlot);\r\n\r\n    /**\r\n     * @notice Get the number of decimals the token uses for value -

Further explanation can be found in the 'design decision' section for this method.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Rules\r\n\r\n**_approving rules:_**\r\n\r\nFor being compatible with ERC-721, ERC-3525 provides four kinds of approving functions indicating different levels of approvals, which can be described as full level approval, slot level approval, token ID level approval as well as value level approval.\r\n\r\n- `setApprovalForAll`, inherited from ERC721, SHOULD indicate the full level of approval, which means that the authorized operators are capable of managing all the tokens, including their values, owned by the owner.\r\n- `setApprovalForSlot` (optional) SHOULD indicate the slot level of approval, which means that the authorized operators are capable of managing all the tokens with the specified slot, including their values, owned by the owner.\r\n- The token ID level `approve` function, inherited from ERC721, SHOULD indicate that the authorized operator is capable of managing only the specified token ID, including its value, owned by the owner.\r\n- The value level `approve` function, overloaded with a `_value` parameter, SHOULD indicate that the authorized operator is capable of managing the specified maximum value of the specified token owned by the owner.\r\n- For any approving function, the caller MUST be the owner or has been approved with a higher level of authority.\r\n\r\n**_transferFrom rules:_**\r\n\r\n- The `transferFrom(uint256 _fromTokenId, uint256 _toTokenId, uint256 _value)` function, SHOULD indicate value transfers from one token to another token, in accordance with the rules below:\r\n\r\n  - MUST revert unless `msg.sender` is the owner of `_fromTokenId`, an authorized operator or an operator who has been approved the whole token or at least `_value` of it.\r\n  - MUST revert if `_fromTokenId` or `_toTokenId` is zero token id or does not exist.\r\n  - MUST revert if slots of `_fromTokenId` and `_toTokenId` do not match.\r\n  - MUST revert if `_value` exceeds the value of `_fromTokenId` or its allowance to the operator.\r\n  - MUST emit `TransferValue` event.\r\n\r\n- The `transferFrom(uint256 _fromTokenId, address _to, uint256 _value)` function, which transfers value from one token ID to an address, SHOULD follow the rule below:\r\n\r\n  - MUST create a new ERC3525 token with the same slot to receive the transferred value.\r\n  - MUST revert unless `msg.sender` is the owner of `_fromTokenId`, an authorized operator or an operator who has been approved the whole token or at least `_value` of it.\r\n  - MUST revert if `_fromTokenId` is zero token id or does not exist.\r\n  - MUST revert if `_to` is zero address.\r\n  - MUST revert if `_value` exceeds the value of `_fromTokenId` or its allowance to the operator.\r\n  - MUST emit `Transfer` and `TransferValue` events.\r\n\r\n**_safeTransferFrom rules:_**\r\n\r\n- `safeTransferFrom` SHOULD be used to implement the same function as `transferFrom`, with an extra step to check if the recipient is capable of receiving ERC-3525 tokens by implementing the `onERC3525Received` interface.\r\n- MUST follow the above rules set for `transferFrom`.\r\n- MUST check if `_to` is a smart contract (code size > 0). If so, `safeTransferFrom` MUST call `onERC3525Received` on `_to` and MUST revert if the return value does not match `bytes4(keccak256(\"onERC3525Received(address,uint256,uint256,uint256,bytes)\"))`\r\n\r\n### Metadata\r\n\r\n#### Metadata Extensions\r\n\r\nERC-3525 metadata extensions are compatible ERC-721 metadata extensions.\r\n\r\nThe optional ERC3525Metadata extension can be identified with the ERC-165 Standard Interface Detection.\r\n\r\n```solidity\r\npragma solidity ^0.8.0;\r\n\r\n/**\r\n * @title ERC-3525 Semi-Fungible Token Standard, optional extension for metadata\r\n * @dev Interfaces for any contract that wants to support query of the Uniform Resource Identifier\r\n *  (URI) for the ERC3525 contract as well as a specified slot. \r\n *  Because of the higher reliability of data stored in smart contracts compared to data stored in \r\n *  centralized systems, it is recommended that metadata, including `contractURI`, `slotURI` and \r\n *  `tokenURI`, be directly returned in JSON format, instead of being returned with a url pointing \r\n *  to any resource stored in a centralized system. \r\n *  See https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-3525\r\n * Note: the ERC-165 identifier for this interface is 0xe1600902.\r\n */\r\ninterface IERC3525Metadata is\r\n    IERC3525 /* , IERC721Metadata */\r\n{\r\n    /**\r\n     * @notice Returns the Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) for the current ERC3525 contract.\r\n     * @dev This function SHOULD return the URI for this contract in JSON format, starting with\r\n     *  header `data:application/json;`.\r\n     *  See https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-3525 for the JSON schema for contract URI.\r\n     * @return The JSON formatted URI of the current ERC3525 contract\r\n     */\r\n    function contractURI() external view returns (string memory);\r\n\r\n    /**\r\n     * @notice Returns the Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) for the specified slot.\r\n     * @dev This function SHOULD return the URI for `_slot` in JSON format, starting with header\r\n     *  `data:application/json;`.\r\n     *  See https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-3525 for the JSON schema for slot URI.\r\n     * @return The JSON formatted URI of `_slot`\r\n     */\r\n    function slotURI(uint256 _slot) external view returns (string memory);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### ERC-3525 Metadata URI JSON Schema\r\n\r\nThis is the \"ERC-3525 Metadata JSON Schema for contractURI()\" referenced above.\r\n\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  \"title\": \"Contract Metadata\",\r\n  \"type\": \"object\",\r\n  \"properties\": {\r\n    \"name\": {\r\n      \"type\": \"string\",\r\n      \"description\": \"Contract Name\"\r\n    },\r\n    \"description\": {\r\n      \"type\": \"string\",\r\n      \"description\": \"Describes the contract \"\r\n    },\r\n    \"valueDecimals\": {\r\n      \"type\": \"integer\",\r\n      \"description\": \"The number of decimal places that the balance should display - e.g. 18, means to divide the token value by 1000000000000000000 to get its user representation.\"\r\n    },\r\n    \"properties\": {\r\n      \"type\": \"object\",\r\n      \"description\": \"Arbitrary properties.

Values may be strings, numbers, objects or arrays.\"\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Approval\r\n\r\nERC-3525 introduces a new approval model, where users can approve operators for transferring value from a token with certain ID: `function approve(address to, uint256 tokenId, uint256 value); `\r\n\r\n## Rationale\r\n\r\n### Metadata generation\r\n\r\nThe ERC-3525 token standard is designed to represent semi-fungible assets, which are most suited for financial instruments rather than collectibles or in-game items. For maximum transparency and safety of digital assets, the implementation should generate metadata directly from contract code rather than giving out a server URL.\r\n\r\n### Design decision: Value transfer from token to address\r\n\r\nThe ‘value’ of an ERC-3525 token is a property of the token and is not linked to an address, so to transfer the value to an address would be actually transferring it to a token owned by that address, not the address itself.\r\n\r\nFrom the implementation perspective, the process of transferring values from token to address is as follows: (1) create a new token, (2) transfer the value to the new token from the 'source token', and (3) transfer the new token to the recipient’s address. So that this method is not fully independent from the ID-to-ID transfer method, and can be viewed as syntactic sugar that wraps the three-step process above.\r\n\r\nIn a special case, if the destination address owns one or more tokens with the same slot value as the source token, this method will have an alternative implemention as follows: (1) find one token owned by the address with the same slot value of the source token, (2) trnasfer the value to the found token. Both implementation should be treated as compliant with this standard.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of maintaining this function is to maximize the compatibility with most wallet apps, since for most of the token standards, the destination of token transfer are addresses. This syntactic wrapping will help wallet apps easily implement the value transfer function from an ERC-3525 token to any address.\r\n\r\n### Design decision: Keep unsafe transfer\r\n\r\nThere are mainly two reasons we keep the unsafe transfer interfaces:\r\n\r\n1. Since ERC-3525 token is ERC-721 compatible, we must keep compatibility for all wallets and contracts that are still calling unsafe transfer interfaces for ERC-721 tokens.\r\n2. We want to keep the ability that dapps can trigger business logic on contracts by simply transferring ERC-3525 tokens to them, that is, a contract can put business logic in `onERC3525Received` function so that it can be called whenever a token is transferred using `safeTransferFrom`. However, in this situation, an approved contract with customized transfer functions like deposit etc. SHOULD never call `safeTransferFrom` since it will result in confusion that whether `onERC3525Received` is called by itself or other dapps that call the safeTransferFrom function.\r\n\r\n### Approval\r\n\r\nFor maximal semantic compatibility with ERC-721 and simplification of the approval model, we decided to make the relationship between two levels of approval like that:\r\n\r\nApproval of an id does not lead to the ability to partially transfer values from this id by the approved operator;\r\nApproval of total values in a token does not lead to the ability to transfer the token entity by the approved operator;\r\nsetApprovalForAll will lead to the ability to transfer any tokens from the owner and to partially transfer values from any token.\r\nsetApprovalForAll will lead to the ability to approve any tokens of the owner to third parties, as well as the ability to approve partial transfer of values of any token to a third party.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Backwards Compatibility\r\n\r\nAs mentioned in the beginning, ERC-3525 is an extension interface of ERC-721, and therefore 100% compatible with the latter.\r\n\r\n## Implementations\r\n\r\n- [SOLV Vouchers - VNFT-core](https://github.com/solv-finance/solv-v2-voucher/tree/main/packages/solv-vnft-core/contracts)\r\n\r\n## Copyright\r\n\r\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).\r\n",

So do I have to wait for the thread to be approved and then I can quote the thread in the PR of ERC-3525, or I can first submit the new modifications in a PR and later change the discussion-to URL to Ethereum Magicians after the thread is approved?\r\n\r\nThanks a lot.\r\n\r\n",
