    "body": "We have discussed superseded in the past and have decided against it.  The primary reason (IMO) for not including superseded is that it means someone has to *decide* which EIPs supersede which.  For example, there are dozens of token contracts that are better than ERC-20 and all of them would love to be the \"official\" token that supersedes ERC-20 and have EIP-20 point at them, but who would make the decision which one is the one that actually supersedes it?\r\n\r\nSimilarly, what if someone claims to supersede ERC-20 but not everyone agrees that it does and some people think ERC-20 is still the \"correct\" token contract?\r\n\r\nTL;DR: it is a governance nightmare to add `superseded-by` to an EIP.\r\n\r\nWe could have a `supersedes` field on EIPs that points *backward*, but I feel like that wouldn't add much value and every token would *claim* to supersede ERC-20 and I fear there would be user confusion because people would assume that when they saw that there was some official process by which a token supersedes another, when really it is just the author saying \"you should use this instead of that\".",

    "body": "My feeling is that we want each standard to stand on its own merit, and not be standing on the merit of the author's prior work.  Someone can make a great standard, and then 2 years later make a terrible standard.  *Most* people likely don't know which is better but they receive a breadcrumb to the new (terrible) standard when they should have gone and sought feedback from the broader community.\r\n\r\nImagine if today Fabian created a new token contract and updated ERC-20 to say that their new token superseded ERC-20.  *Many* developers, particularly new developers, would run off and start implementing this new token even though there are a dozen token standards out there that are all better than ERC-20 and many of which may be better than the new standard that Fabian created.\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nAnother thing to consider is that allowing the addition of superseded can introduce some pathological incentive games where someone who authors a popular EIP (ERC-20, ERC-721, ERC-1155, etc.) can sell rights to the superseded field to authors of future EIPs.  Basically you just agree that you'll add a superseded field pointing at the highest bidder's EIP which can then be used for advertising a new standard.  By making EIPs immutable, we avoid this entire can of worms.",

If we get a chance I love to share more about my views and learn about yours.\n\nSince we are also having a proposal of auctioning the EIP numbers, and many decisions of EIP process start to become increasing complecated, some governance needs to be set up.\n\nI am not calling for *any particular form*(how) of governance, but to call for the *start discussion of EIP governance*(whether). I can do some brainstorming and I do have opinion about \"how\", but that would be second step. The first step is to address the question of \"whether\"\n",
