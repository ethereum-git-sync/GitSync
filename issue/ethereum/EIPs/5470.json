For example, Token Issuing  process, issuer can receive money from  buyers( or investors) and transfers issuing token to buyers. If offering process is successfully completed, there is no issue. But buyers can change their plan, or offering is failed(or canceled) cause of mis-fitting the compliance rules or other rules. There is no way guarantee to payback(refund) to buyer in on-chain network.\r\n\r\nWe have suggest this process make possible in on-chain network with payable currency like token(ex: USDT)\r\n\r\n\r\n## Motivation\r\n\r\nA standard interface allows payable token contract to interact with ERC-2000 interface within smart contracts.\r\n\r\nAny payable token contract call ERC-2000 interface to exchange with issuing token based on constraint built in ERC-2000 smart contract to validate transactions.\r\n\r\nNote: Refund is only available in certain conditions(ex: period, oracle value etc) based on implementations.\r\n\r\n## Requirements\r\n\r\nExchanging tokens, requires having an escrow like standard way in on-chain network.\r\n\r\nThe following stand interfaces should be provided on ERC-2000 interface.\r\n  - MUST support querying texted based compliance for transactions. ex: period, max number of buyers, minimum and maximum tokens to hold, refund period, etc.\r\n  - exchange(or purchase) with success or failed return code.\r\n  - refund(or cancel transaction) with success or failed return code.\r\n  - withdraw when escrow process has been success.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Specification\r\n\r\nThe key words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\", \"SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\", \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"MAY\", and \"OPTIONAL\" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.\r\n\r\nThere are 3 contracts for the escrow process: `Buyer Contract`, `Seller Contract` and `Escrow Contract`.\r\n - Buyer Contract: Buyers will pay to escrow account to exchange with `Seller Token`.\r\n - Seller Contract: The seller will pay to escrow account to exchange with `Buyer Token`.\r\n - Escrow Contract: Will be created by seller. Agent to co-operate between buyers and seller based on constraint rules. Instead of simple address mapped balance variable in ERC20 tokens, this balance should have (Seller, Buyer).\r\n\r\n**Every ERC-2000 compliant contract must implement the `ERC2000` interfaces**\r\n\r\n```solidity\r\npragma solidity ^0.4.20;\r\n\r\n/// @title ERC-2000 Refundable Token Standard\r\n\r\ninterface ERC2000 {\r\n\r\n    /// @notice escrow balance of owner\r\n    /// @dev assigned to the zero address are considered invalid, and this\r\n    ///   function throws for queries about the zero address.\r\n    ///   in case of escrow contract,\r\n    ///       recommend return buyer's token balance.\r\n    ///       used for backward compatibility with ERC20 standard.\r\n    /// @param\r\n    ///   - _owner: An address for whom to query the balance\r\n    /// @return amount of current escrow account balance. can be seller's token or buyer's token\r\n    function balanceOf(address account) public view returns (uint256);\r\n\r\n\r\n    /// @notice escrow balance of owner\r\n    /// @dev assigned to the zero address are considered invalid, and this\r\n    ///   function throws for queries about the zero address.\r\n    /// @param\r\n    ///   - _owner: An address for whom to query the balance\r\n    /// @return amount of current escrow account balance.

It means constraint rules might not be changed for ever(might be changed after created for market exchange rate.), so it guarantee escrow policy.\r\n\r\n2. **escrowFund**\r\n\r\nThis function should run differently for buyer and seller.\r\n\r\n[seller]\r\n- The seller call this function to be escrow-ready. Seller's token ownership(balance) will be transferred to escrow-contract and escrow balance will be (Seller: amount, Buyer: 0).\r\n- The seller can call this function multiple times depends on implementation, but preferred just one time.\r\n\r\n[buyer]\r\n- When escrow is in running state(not success or failed), the buyer can call this function to deposit fund into escrow account.\r\n- the escrow balance will be (Seller: amount x exchange-rate, Buyer: amount). The `Buyer: amount` will be used for refund process.\r\n- Once it is success, the seller's escrow balance will be (Seller: -= amount x exchange-rate, Buyer: += amount).\r\n\r\n3. **escrowRefund**\r\n\r\nThis function should be invoked by buyers only.\r\nThe buyer can call this function in running state only. In state of failed or success, could not be success.\r\nThe escrow balances of seller and buyer will be updated reverse way of `escrowFund`\r\n\r\n\r\n4. **escrowWithdraw**\r\n\r\nBuyers and seller can withdraw tokens from escrow account to their own account.\r\nThe following processes are recommended.\r\n- Buyer can withdraw in escrow-success state only. Ownership of seller tokens can be transferred to buyer from escrow-contract. In escrow-failed state, buyer should call `escrowRefund` function.\r\n- When the seller call this function in escrow-success state, remained seller token will be transferred to seller, and earned buyer's token will be also transferred from escrow-account.\r\n- In case of escrow-failed, seller only get refund seller token.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Backwards Compatibility\r\n\r\nBy design ERC-2000 is fully backwards compatible with ERC-20.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Test Cases & Implementations\r\n\r\n1. [Seller/Buyer Token example](https://github.com/StartfundInc/erc-refundable-token-standard/blob/main/contracts/examples/ERC20Mockup.sol)\r\n\r\n2. [Escrow contract example](https://github.com/StartfundInc/erc-refundable-token-standard/blob/main/contracts/examples/ErcEscrowAccount.sol)\r\n\r\n3. [Unit test example](https://github.com/StartfundInc/erc-refundable-token-standard/blob/main/test/escrow-test.js).\r\n\r\n## Security Considerations\r\n\r\nSince the external contract(Escrow Contract) will control seller or buyer rights, flaws within the escrow contract directly lead to the standard’s unexpected behavior.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Copyright\r\n\r\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://eips.ethereum.org/LICENSE).\r\n",
