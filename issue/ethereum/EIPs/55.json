  "body": "EDITOR UPDATE (2017-08-24): This EIP is now located at https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-55. Please go there for the correct specification. The text below may be incorrect or outdated, and is not maintained.\r\n-----\r\n\r\nCode:\r\n\r\n``` python\r\ndef checksum_encode(addr): # Takes a 20-byte binary address as input\r\n    o = ''\r\n    v = utils.big_endian_to_int(utils.sha3(addr))\r\n    for i, c in enumerate(addr.encode('hex')):\r\n        if c in '0123456789':\r\n            o += c\r\n        else:\r\n            o += c.upper() if (v & (2**(255 - i))) else c.lower()\r\n    return '0x'+o\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn English, convert the address to hex, but if the ith digit is a letter (ie. it's one of `abcdef`) print it in uppercase if the ith bit of the hash of the address (in binary form) is 1 otherwise print it in lowercase.\r\n\r\nBenefits:\r\n- Backwards compatible with many hex parsers that accept mixed case, allowing it to be easily introduced over time\r\n- Keeps the length at 40 characters\r\n- ~~The average address will have 60 check bits, and less than 1 in 1 million addresses will have less than 32 check bits; this is stronger performance than nearly all other check schemes. Note that the very tiny chance that a given address will have very few check bits is dwarfed by the chance in any scheme that a bad address will randomly pass a check~~\r\n\r\nUPDATE: I was actually wrong in my math above. I forgot that the check bits are per-hex-character, not per-bit (facepalm). On average there will be 15 check bits per address, and the net probability that a randomly generated address if mistyped will accidentally pass a check is 0.0247%. This is a ~50x improvement over ICAP, but not as good as a 4-byte check code.\r\n\r\nExamples:\r\n- `0xCd2a3d9f938e13Cd947eC05ABC7fe734df8DD826` (the \"cow\" address)\r\n- `0x9Ca0e998dF92c5351cEcbBb6Dba82Ac2266f7e0C`\r\n- `0xcB16D0E54450Cdd2368476E762B09D147972b637`\r\n",

    "body": "I saw comments on the [TurboEthereum](https://gavofyork.gitbooks.io/turboethereum/content/ethkey.html) guide that suggested that we were moving away from raw hex keys into ICAP keys:\n\n> ICAP: XE472EVKU3CGMJF2YQ0J9RO1Y90BC0LDFZ\n> Raw hex: 0092e965928626f8880629cec353d3fd7ca5974f\n\n\"Notice the last two lines there. One is the ICAP address, the other is the raw hexadecimal address. The latter is an older representation of address that you'll sometimes see and is being phased out in favour of the shorter ICAP address which also includes a checksum to avoid problems with mistyping. All normal (aka direct) ICAP addresses begin with XE so you should be able to recognise them easily.\"\n\nMy concern is that if there was a previous decision to start moving to ICAP, I'm not sure if this will add confusion. However, if this helps give raw hex addresses a checksum I guess that can only be beneficial, even if everyone wants to move to ICAP eventually.\n",

Although it offers superior backwards compatibility, I believe will only cause additional confusion to the end-user.\n\nSince the change in format serves to make the address less error prone through checksums, I posit they should also be immediately recognizable through a fixed prefix or otherwise obvious identifier. One reason why I prefer ICAP over this proposed solution is that it signals to the user clearly that this is an Ethereum address and cannot be confused with a transaction/block hash.\n",

    "body": "I did a rudimentary implementation on javascript in the web3 object:\n\n``` js\nvar isAddress = function (address) {\n    if (!/^(0x)?[0-9a-f]{40}$/i.test(address)) {\n        // check if it has the basic requirements of an address\n        return false;\n    } else if (/^(0x)?[0-9a-f]{40}$/.test(address) || /^(0x)?[0-9A-F]{40}$/.test(address)) {\n        // If it's all small caps or all all caps, return true\n        return true;\n    } else {\n        // Otherwise check each case\n        address = address.replace('0x','');\n\n        // creates the case map using the binary form of the hash of the address\n        var caseMap = parseInt(web3.sha3('0x'+address.toLowerCase()),16).toString(2).substring(0, 40);\n\n        for (var i = 0; i < 40; i++ ) { \n            // the nth letter should be uppercase if the nth digit of casemap is 1\n            if ((caseMap[i] == '1' && address[i].toUpperCase() != address[i])|| (caseMap[i] == '0' && address[i].toLowerCase() != address[i])) {\n                return false;\n            }\n        }\n        return true;\n    }\n};\n\n\n/**\n * Makes a checksum address\n *\n * @method toChecksumAddress\n * @param {String} address the given HEX adress\n * @return {String}\n*/\nvar toChecksumAddress = function (address) {\n\n    var checksumAddress = '0x';\n    address = address.toLowerCase().replace('0x','');\n\n    // creates the case map using the binary form of the hash of the address\n    var caseMap = parseInt(web3.sha3('0x'+address),16).toString(2).substring(0, 40);\n\n    for (var i = 0; i < address.length; i++ ) {  \n        if (caseMap[i] == '1') {\n          checksumAddress += address[i].toUpperCase();\n        } else {\n            checksumAddress += address[i];\n        }\n    }\n\n    console.log('create: ', address, caseMap, checksumAddress)\n    return checksumAddress;\n};\n```\n\nIt works internally and it's almost invisible to the user. I don't really see a good reason not to implement it. \nMy results don't match yours, @vbuterin it might be interesting to figure out why. Here are my results omitting the '0x' before hashing the address:\n- `0xCD2a3d9F938e13cd947Ec05AbC7fE734dF8dd826`\n- `0x9CA0E998df92C5351CeCBBb6DBa82Ac2266F7E0c`\n- `0xCb16d0e54450cDd2368476E762b09D147972B637`\n\nAnd here the results including `0x` on the hash of the address:\n- `0xCd2A3D9f938e13CD947ec05abC7Fe734dF8dd826`\n- `0x9Ca0e998DF92c5351CECbBb6DbA82ac2266F7e0C`\n- `0xCB16D0e54450cDD2368476e762b09d147972B637`\n",

    "body": "Good catch, I switched to the sha3 of the binary but the results still won't match. I'm a bit confused on what you meant by `# Takes a 20-byte binary address as input`. Ethereum addresses are 160 bits..\n\nFor example:\n- address: `0xcd2a3d9f938e13cd947ec05abc7fe734df8dd826` (why cow? What joke did I miss?)\n- To binary: `1100110100101010001111011001111110010011100011100001001111001101100101000111111011000000010110101011110001111111111001110011010011011111100011011101100000100110`\n- First 40 binary digits of the sha3 of the binary: `1110011101011010000000000110010011011010`\n- That means it should start with three uppercase letters, followed by 2 lowercases, followed by 3 upper etc: `0xCD2a3D9F938E13Cd947ec05abC7fe734DF8DD826` not `0xCd2a3d9f938e13Cd947eC05ABC7fe734df8DD826` in your example.\n\nI suppose I am misunderstanding what you are using as input..\n\nPS: you can probably simplify your example by not checking for letters: you can do uppercase conversions on numbers and although there [is such a thing as a lowercase digits](http://i.stack.imgur.com/W89P2.jpg) they are represented the same\n",

I think the whole point of this scheme is that it's completely backwards compatible. There's no point in separating them. In my implementation, if the address is all caps or all small caps then it assumes to be a unchecksummed address. In a 40 char address, there will be in average 15 letters, the chances of all of them being the same case is 1:16384 so I guess it's strong enough.\n",

If you make a typo in a non checksum enabled wallet you'll lose your ether, just like you do now, and it's that particular wallet's developer job to make that client more secure. \n\nAlso, I don't think copying by hand is the main situation here, if we were trying to optimize that then we should be talking about pseudo-word seeds and name registries. Checksums are just extra securities against accidental typos, letters that were cut out by copying the wrong digit and are an extra assurance to the user that the address is still intact, just like the icon is. \n\nI don't really see any disadvantage of adding these are they were very simple to implement to web3.js\n\nAlthough I still haven't matched the initial implementation, probably because basic primitives on Python are very different than what JavaScript comes up with. Since a lot of implementations will be JavaScript I still think it makes more sense to use the sha of the hex, since that's how it comes to the library.. \n\n> On Feb 19, 2016, at 18:08, Piper Merriam notifications@github.com wrote:\n> \n> In that case do you think we should not worry about checksumming at all?

We already have a proposed standard without backwards compatibility that adopts more characters it's called IBAN\n\nThe IBAN / ICAP proposal is pretty bad though for those of us who want to use any wallet w/ HD capabilities. If you want HD, you can't have compatible IBAN/ICAP addresses in which case, you might as well just pick something else. Base58-check encoding is a good compromise that's familiar and easy to implement.\n",
