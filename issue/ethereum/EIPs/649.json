It has been discussed in several all-core-dev meetings. However, it clearly needs an EIP if this should be included in Metropolis. Previously discussed here:\r\n\r\n- [All Core Devs Meeting #09](https://github.com/ethereum/pm/blob/master/All%20Core%20Devs%20Meetings/Meeting%209.md#metropolis-timing-and-roadmap-discussion)\r\n- [All Core Devs Meeting #12](https://github.com/ethereum/pm/blob/master/All%20Core%20Devs%20Meetings/Meeting%2012.md#5-metropolis-update)\r\n- [All Core Devs Meeting #13](https://github.com/ethereum/pm/blob/master/All%20Core%20Devs%20Meetings/Meeting%2013.md#3-eip-186-reduce-eth-issuance-before-proof-of-stake-hudson) (in context of #186)\r\n- [All Core Devs Meeting #14](https://github.com/ethereum/pm/blob/master/All%20Core%20Devs%20Meetings/Meeting%2014.md#1-eip-186-reduce-eth-issuance-before-proof-of-stake-core-devs) (in context of #186)\r\n\r\n## Simple Summary, Abstract, and Motivation\r\nThe average block time is 17.49 seconds and slowly increasing due to the _difficulty bomb_. That makes users sad. This EIP is suggesting to delay the bomb significantly, to reduce average block times below 15 seconds, and to allow more time for Serenity development.\r\n\r\n## Specification, Rationale, Compatibility, Test Cases, Implementation\r\n_To be specified asap:_ \"Idea was that we add special rules to the difficulty calculation to effectively pause the difficulty between different blocks.\" (Peter)\r\n\r\n## Copyright\r\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).",
