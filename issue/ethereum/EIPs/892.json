A contract can need to know if an address has the right to interact with it or if an item belongs to the list of permitted items (ex: curated list).\r\nThis standard is straightforward but required for interoperability.\r\n\r\nSpecification\r\n--------------\r\n\r\n### isPermitted\r\n\r\nThis function returns `true` if the element is permitted, `false` otherwise.\r\nSpecific types can be used instead of`bytes32` as long as they are not longer than 32 bytes.\r\n``` is\r\nfunction isPermitted(bytes32 _element) returns(bool permitted)\r\n```\r\n\r\nRationale\r\n--------------\r\n- Contracts and interfaces sometimes need to know if some particular element is permitted or not.\r\n- The standard allows the abstraction of the permission brick of a dapp. It allows parties to choose a contract with arbitrary complex rules to determine if an element is permitted or not.\r\n- Allowing types others than bytes32 provides better typing, thus better readability, without breaking interoperability.\r\n\r\nImplementations\r\n--------------\r\n- https://github.com/kleros/kleros-interaction/tree/master/contracts/standard/permission\r\n- https://github.com/ensdomains/blacklist/blob/master/contracts/Blacklist.sol\r\n",

The use-case I had in mind was:\r\nContract A wants to know whether a particular operation `op` on Contract B is valid. Instead of calling `op` and hoping it doesn't throw, it can call `isPermissioned` with relevant args first, which returns a `bool` to determine whether the subsequent call to `op` will work or not.\r\n\r\nFor this use-case, obviously a fairly flexible `isPermissioned` is needed (whose logic would depend on the details of `op`).
