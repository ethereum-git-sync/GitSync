  "body": "## Preamble\r\n```\r\nEIP: 909\r\nTitle: New opcode STORREVERT - Revert contract state back to specific block\r\nAuthor: Nick Dodson <thenickdodson@gmail.com>\r\nCategory: EVM\r\nCreated: 2018-02-28\r\nUpdated: 2018-02-28\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Abstract\r\nThe following EIP describes an opcode which would revert a contracts memory storage and layout (state) back to a specific block.\r\n\r\n## Motivation\r\nMany contract systems are growing in complexity and will want a simple way to revert and reset contractual changes or upgrades. Having a simple opcode which can do this would greatly increase the capability of the Ethereum virtual machine. This would also allow Ethereum contracts to be extremely amorphic in nature (if used in tandem with delegatecall like functionality).\r\n\r\n## Specification\r\nIntroduce a new `STORREVERT` (memory revert) flag to the virtual machine. This opcode has no default values. It has one required parameter which is the block number to revert contract memory to.\r\n\r\nOpcode: `0xfc`\r\n\r\nThe single parameter, block number, is invalid if it is set past the contract deployment block or ahead of the current block number.\r\n\r\n## Example\r\n1) A delegate proxy is deployed with memory storage slot `master` (which defines the delegatecall target) at block A\r\n2) The delegate proxy P defines it's master variable to contract Y at block B\r\n3) Now the delegate proxy P is effectively contract Y\r\n--- The proxy owner now wants to change P's `master` to contract Z\r\n3) The delegate proxy P calls `STORREVERT A` and then assigns the `master` to contract address of Z\r\n4) The delegate proxy P is now effectively contract Z\r\n\r\n## Rational\r\nThis allows contracts to easily reset and revert memory / storage slots back to a specific block in time with relative ease.\r\n\r\n## Implementation\r\nWhen processing this opcode, the client would simply ignore all state changes between the STORREVERT block number and the current transaction block number in which the opcode was processed.\r\n\r\n## Alternatives\r\nIf this is far to complex to implement in the client, an alternative would be to have a STORREVERT, whereby the memory of a contract is simply reset to the memory layout / state when it was deployed (which would take no parameters). \r\n\r\nIt seems after learning more about VM processing, the above proposal would be very computationally heavy, as VM's are not required to hold historical state transitions. Another alternative would be a complete wipe of all contract state and storage layout. This would definitely put it in the class of SUICIDE and other similar calls to it. I do believe for upgrade purposes it would be useful.\r\n\r\n## Test Cases\r\nTo be written.\r\n",

I think @chriseth made some comments about this in some EIP but I cannot find it right now!\r\n\r\nAlso great EIP @SilentCicero, I imagine this being a pain to implement in clients but it would be a great tool!",

    "body": "My only issue with this is two fold, one, sometimes you don't know when the right snapshot time is and secondly, if I could just wipe out all storage in a contract, like a full refresh, it would serve the similar purpose for upgrading. I don't believe we actually need a revert per say to fork daos or contracts. I think Aragon would agree as well. You can just take state from the last set of contracts and implement new state and logic in the new dao. The MiniMe token is a good example.\n\nSent from my iPhone\n\n> On Mar 7, 2018, at 5:56 AM, ivica7 <notifications@github.com> wrote:\n> \n> @SilentCicero did you take a look on #905 ?

If you wish to revert to the state after the initialisation of the contract, you could make a snapshot with ``SCLONE`` directly after the initialisation and reset it later with ``SCLONE`` again to this snapshot. Sure you're not flexible like if you could select arbitrary blocks for the revert, but that's the tradeoff for simplifying the implementation.",

It adds a lot of complexity to contract/dapp developers since it means contracts would have to keep Ether in their balance that slowly gets used or they would lose their state, which means users either have to fund this themselves or trust that the developers keep it funded.",

    "body": "The primary use-case is for upgradable contract systems, namely, proxy contracts. Aragon, Colony, Harbour and others working on upgradable governance systems will and already do desire a mechanism to either wipe contracts clear of storage or bring them back to a specific state along the upgrade process of a contract. This EIP is the start of a discussion toward that aim of clean upgradable contracts. I believe that this kind of mechanism should exist, at least in the storage clearing form. \n\nSent from my iPhone\n\n> On Mar 12, 2018, at 5:32 PM, William Entriken <notifications@github.com> wrote:\n> \n> This EIP lacks a very strong and specific use case.
