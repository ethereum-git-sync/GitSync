  "body": "Author: Vitalik Buterin\r\nCategory: Meta\r\nPublished: 2018 Apr 1\r\n\r\nIn order to ensure the economic sustainability of the platform under the widest possible variety of circumstances, and in light of the fact that issuing new coins to proof of work miners is no longer an effective way of promoting an egalitarian coin distribution or any other significant policy goal, I propose that we agree on a hard cap for the total quantity of ETH.\r\n\r\nDuring the next hard fork that alters reward distributions (likely phase 1 Casper), this proposal requires redenominating all in-protocol rewards, including mining rewards, staking interest, staking rewards in the sharding system and any other future rewards that may be devised, in \"reward units\", where the definition of reward units is:\r\n\r\n    1 RU = (1 - CURRENT_SUPPLY / MAX_SUPPLY) ETH\r\n\r\nI recommend setting `MAX_SUPPLY = 120,204,432`, or exactly 2x the amount of ETH sold in the original ether sale.\r\n\r\nAssuming MAX_SUPPLY = 120 million, and given the current supply of 98.5 million, that means that 1 RU is now equal to 1 - 98.5m/120m ~= 0.1792 ETH, so if a hard fork were to be implemented today, the 3 ETH block reward would become 16.74 RU. In one month, the ETH supply will grow to ~99.1 million, so 1 RU will reduce to 0.1742 ETH, and so the block reward in ETH would be 16.74 * 0.1742 = 2.91555.\r\n\r\nIn the longer term, the supply would exponentially approach the max cap and the rewards would exponentially approach zero, so if hypothetically Ethereum stays with proof of work forever, this would halve rewards every 744 days. In reality, however, rewards will decrease greatly with the switch to proof of stake, and fees such as [rent](https://ethresear.ch/t/a-simple-and-principled-way-to-compute-rent-fees/1455) (as well as slashed validators) will _decrease_ the ETH supply, so the actual ETH supply will reach some equilibrium below MAX_SUPPLY where rewards and penalties/fees cancel out, and so rewards will always remain at some positive level above zero.\r\n\r\nIf for some reason this EIP is adopted at a point where it is too late to set a max cap at 120 million, it is also possible to set a higher max cap. I would recommend 144,052,828 ETH, or exactly 2x the total amount released in the genesis block including both the sale and premines.",

    "body": "I think a round number such as 120,000,000 would be easier for people to calculate, similar to Bitcoins 21,000,000. Not sure if exactly 2x is entirely necessary. But I think it's great to have a proposal discussing economic suggestions of this sort!\r\n\r\n140M might be seen as too high in some cases.  For example BTC circulating supply is currently 16,951,300 with a max of 21,000,000. That is 23.88% more in total inflation from todays numbers.\r\n\r\nETH circulating supply is 98,545,046 with a theoretical max supply of 120,000,000 would mean a total of 21.77% more in total inflation. \r\n\r\n140M would give us 42.06% more inflation (close to double the rate of BTC)\r\n\r\nI read an article quoting you as saying: “Introducing some kind of sinks into ethereum is definitely something we’re looking at. By sinks, I mean fees that lead to the token actually being destroyed.”\r\n\r\nIs this something that could still potentially become apart of Casper? Wouldn't this then lead to a **decreasing supply over time determined by how much the network is being used**? \r\n\r\nI like this idea a lot personally because it could be said that this would give ETH the properties of increased security based on the network usage increase. The more Ethereum is being used you would have some baked in security increase going hand and hand with this. \r\n\r\nAs the incentive to 51% attack might increase from more value being placed on the network through more transactions, the more difficult it would become on its own as ETH becomes scarcer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
