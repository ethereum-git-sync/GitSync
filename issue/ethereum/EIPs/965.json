  "body": "## Preamble\r\n```\r\nEIP: 965\r\nTitle: Authorize Operator by Cheque (ERC777 extension) - possibility to transfer without paying for gas\r\nAuthor: Jaro Šatkevič @chompomonim, Anatoly Ressin @artazor\r\nType: Standard Track\r\nCategory: ERC\r\nStatus: Draft\r\nCreated: 2018-06-05\r\nRequires: 777\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Problem\r\nThe problem of tokens spending is that token owner have to have ETH in his account to pay for gas. So it's impossible to have pure token account. Even in ERC777 (#777) where you can have operator which can manage your tokens (and paying for gas), there still is same problem of lack of gas to initiate `authorizeOperator` call.\r\n\r\n## Solution\r\n\r\nAdd default operator smart contract which would accept tx with signed permission to send tokens. This tx can be made by anyone who has tokens owner signature and is willing to pay for gas.\r\n\r\n\r\nPossible implementation:\r\n```solidity\r\ncontract ChequeOperator {\r\n    using SafeMath for uint256;\r\n    using ECRecovery for bytes32;\r\n\r\n    struct Agreement {\r\n        uint256 totalPaid;\r\n        address token;\r\n        address payer;\r\n        address beneficiary;\r\n        bytes data;\r\n    }\r\n    mapping(bytes => Agreement) internal agreements;\r\n    mapping(address => mapping(uint256 => bool)) public usedNonces; // For simple sendByCheque\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    /* Simple send by Checque */\r\n    \r\n    function signerOfSimpleCheque(address _token, address _to, uint256 _amount, bytes _data, uint256 _nonce, bytes _sig) private pure returns (address) {\r\n        return keccak256(abi.encodePacked(_token, _to, _amount, _data, _nonce)).toEthSignedMessageHash().recover(_sig);\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    function sendByCheque(address _token, address _to, uint256 _amount, bytes _data, uint256 _nonce, bytes _sig) public {\r\n        require(_to != address(this));\r\n\r\n        // Check if signature is valid and get signer's address\r\n        address signer = signerOfSimpleCheque(_token, _to, _amount, _data, _nonce, _sig);\r\n        require(signer != address(0));\r\n\r\n        // Mark this cheque as used\r\n        require (!usedNonces[signer][_nonce]);\r\n        usedNonces[signer][_nonce] = true;\r\n\r\n        // Send tokens\r\n        ERC777Token token = ERC777Token(_token);\r\n        token.operatorSend(signer, _to, _amount, _data, \"\");\r\n    }\r\n\r\n\r\n    /* Send by Aggreement */\r\n\r\n    function signerOfAgreementCheque(bytes _agreementId, uint256 _amount, uint256 _fee, bytes _sig) private pure returns (address) {\r\n        return keccak256(abi.encodePacked(_agreementId, _amount, _fee)).toEthSignedMessageHash().recover(_sig);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    function createAgreement(bytes _id, address _token, address _payer, address _beneficiary, bytes _data) public {\r\n        require(_beneficiary != address(0));\r\n        require(_payer != address(0));\r\n        //require(ERC777Token(_token));\r\n        require(agreements[_id].beneficiary == address(0));\r\n        agreements[_id] = Agreement({\r\n            totalPaid: 0,\r\n            token: _token,\r\n            payer: _payer,\r\n            beneficiary: _beneficiary,\r\n            data: _data\r\n        });\r\n    } \r\n\r\n    function sendByAgreement(bytes _agreementId, uint256 _amount, uint256 _fee, bytes _sig) public returns (bool) {\r\n        // Check if agreement exists\r\n        Agreement storage agreement = agreements[_agreementId];\r\n        require(agreement.beneficiary != address(0));\r\n\r\n        // Check if signature is valid, remember last running sum\r\n        address signer = signerOfAgreementCheque(_agreementId, _amount, _fee, _sig);\r\n        require(signer == agreement.payer);\r\n\r\n        // Calculate amount of tokens to be send\r\n        uint256 amount = _amount.sub(agreement.totalPaid).sub(_fee);\r\n        require(amount > 0);\r\n\r\n        // If signer has less tokens that asked to transfer, we can transfer as much as he has already\r\n        // and rest tokens can be transferred via same cheque but in another tx \r\n        // when signer will top up his balance.\r\n        ERC777Token token = ERC777Token(agreement.token);\r\n        if (amount > token.balanceOf(signer)) {\r\n            amount = token.balanceOf(signer).sub(_fee);\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        // Increase already paid amount\r\n        agreement.totalPaid = agreement.totalPaid.add(amount);\r\n\r\n        // Send tokens\r\n        token.operatorSend(signer, agreement.beneficiary, amount, agreement.data, \"\");\r\n       \r\n        if (_fee > 0) {\r\n            token.operatorSend(signer, msg.sender, _fee, \"\", \"\");\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        return true;\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\ncontract MyToken is ERC777Token {\r\n    using ECRecovery for bytes32;\r\n    mapping (address => mapping (uint256 => bool)) private usedNonces;\r\n\r\n    constructor(address _checqueOperator) public {\r\n        // Setting checquieOperator as default operator\r\n        //require(ChequeOperator(_checqueOperator));\r\n        mDefaultOperators.push(_checqueOperator);\r\n        mIsDefaultOperator[_checqueOperator] = true;\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nAdditioanlly \r\n\r\nOn user's (wallet) side cheque creation could look like:\r\n```js\r\nconst leftPad = require('left-pad')\r\n\r\nconst hexData = [\r\n    _agreementId,\r\n     leftPad((_amount).toString(16), 64, 0),\r\n     leftPad((_fee).toString(16), 64, 0)\r\n].join('')\r\n\r\nconst msg = web3.sha3(hexData, { encoding: 'hex' }).slice(2)\r\n\r\nconst signature = web3.eth.sign(accounts[0], msg).slice(2)\r\n```\r\n\r\nLater transaction could look like:\r\n```js\r\nawait checqueOperator.sendByAgreement(_agreementId, _amount, _fee, signature)\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Use case \r\nThis kind of cheques could potentially be widely used. Example use-case:\r\n\r\n**Frequent payments use case** situation where shop gives discount points for client in a form of tokens. Also client downloads special app which is not only loyalty app but also is some kind of wallet and stores private key.\r\n\r\nLater, when client will want to use such points (e.g. could be many times per day), without depositing some amount of gwei into his 'token wallet', he will not be able to transfer tokens. Meanwhile this token wallet could sign cheque and transfer it to shop back. Then shop (or some another entity) using this cheque could transfer tokens while paying for gas by himself.\r\n\r\n**Merchant use case** the merchant generates a one-time address (OTA) and associates it with an invoice/order. The buyer transfers tokens to OTA as a means of paying the invoice.\r\n\r\nNow the merchant wants to sweep the tokens out of OTA, but OTA cannot pay for the gas since it has no ether. So the merchant needs to send yet another transaction to fund OTA with just enough gas so it can sweep the tokens out.\r\n\r\nThe cheque model solves this problem by allowing the merchant to call sendByCheque and get the tokens out of OTA while paying for the gas from his own (master) account. This is possible because the merchant already controls OTA's keys and can produce the signature for the check.",

I find it useful for another payment-related core use case: the merchant generates a **one-time address** (OTA) and associates it with an invoice/order.

It makes life easier for the services that need to accept payments denominated in that token, as they won't need to go through the extra-steps of sending additional transactions only for funding the one-time accounts with the gas that is later required to sweep the tokens out of those accounts.\r\n\r\n@chompomonim how should we move forward for bringing this proposal on the table for the #777 standard?",

    "body": "Let's imagine a situation where an issuer signs a series of cheques for one person (for example 100 cheques). When a person wants to withdraw all his collected cheques, he will have to send each cheque to the blockchain and pay for each transaction. This consumes a lot of gas. What if he could withdraw all his collected cheques with one tx? A little change in the code can do that.\r\n```solidity\r\nmapping(address => mapping(address => uint256)) public paidChequeSum;\r\nfunction sendByCheque(address _to, uint256 _value, bytes _data, uint8 v, bytes32 r, bytes32 s) public returns (bool) {\r\n     require(_to != address(this));\r\n\r\n     // Check if signature is valid, remember last running sum\r\n     bytes memory prefix = \"\\x19Ethereum Signed Message:\\n32\";\r\n     bytes32 hash = keccak256(prefix, keccak256(_to, _value, _data));\r\n\r\n     address signer = ecrecover(hash, v, r, s);\r\n     require(signer != address(0));\r\n\r\n     uint256 amount = _value.sub(paidChequeSum[signer][_to]);\r\n     require(amount > 0);\r\n\r\n     if (amount > balances[signer]) {\r\n         amount = balances[signer];\r\n     }\r\n\r\n    // Increase already paid amount\r\n    paidChequeSum[signer][_to] = paidChequeSum[signer][_to].add(amount);\r\n\r\n    doSend(signer, _to, amount, _data, msg.sender, \"\", false);\r\n\r\n    return true;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n- First thing to notice is the `_value` parameter. It is a running sum of sent tokens to a certain address. For example issuer issues a series of cheques with 2 tokens in each cheque. The first cheque will have `_value=2`, the second - `_value=4`, third - `_value=6`, etc.\r\n- Second, `_nonce` argument disappears, since `_value` is always increasing it plays the `_nonce` role.\r\n- Third, in current implementation, if the cheque issuer does not have enough funds on his balance the tx is rolled back. In proposed implementation a user will receive all remaining tokens on issuer balance and later a user can retry to withdraw left tokens using the same cheque.\r\n- User is not forced to store all cheques to withdraw them, he can store only the latest one and withdraw all tokens with the latest cheque in one tx (if issuer have enough balance).\r\n\r\nOf course there are some drawbacks:\r\n- Issuer needs to track running sum for each user offchain, because issuer cannot get the latest issued cheque sum onchain (the cheque may not be withdrawn at the moment)\r\n- If the cheque series for a certain address is too large it can hit `uint256` overflow\r\n\r\nFor both drawbacks the solution may be \"Use the other `_to` address!\". When issuer is in doubt of a running sum, he may ask a user for a clean address. For second drawback the same rule applies. When a cheque series is close to `uint256` overflow, issuer may ask user for a clean address.",

So it's impossible to have pure token account. Even in ERC777 (#777) where you can have operator which can manage your tokens (and paying for gas), there still is same problem of lack of gas to initiate `authorizeOperator` call.\r\n\r\n## Solution\r\n\r\nAdd possibility to authorize operator by cheque. User could sign permission and send to operator via any wanted channels. Operator would send tx with signed permission into blockchain by himself so user would not need to pay for gas.\r\n\r\nPossible function's implementation:\r\n```solidity\r\ncontract MyToken is ERC777 {\r\n    using ECRecovery for bytes32;\r\n    mapping (address => mapping (uint256 => bool)) private usedNonces;\r\n\r\n    function authorizeOperatorByCheque(address _operator, uint256 _nonce, bytes _sig) public returns (bool) {\r\n        require(_operator != address(this));\r\n\r\n        // Getting signer address\r\n        address signer = keccak256(_operator, _nonce).toEthSignedMessageHash().recover(_sig);\r\n        require (signer != address(0));\r\n\r\n        // Setting nonce to protect against repeating authorization in future\r\n        require (!usedNonces[signer][_nonce]);\r\n        usedNonces[signer][_nonce] = true;\r\n\r\n        // Authorizing operator\r\n        require(_operator != signer);\r\n        isOperatorFor[_operator][signer] = true;\r\n        emit AuthorizedOperator(_operator, signer);\r\n\r\n        return true;\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\nOn user's (wallet) side cheque creation could look like:\r\n```js\r\nconst leftPad = require('left-pad')\r\n\r\nconst hexData = [\r\n     _operator.slice(2),\r\n     leftPad((_nonce).toString(16), 64, 0)\r\n].join('')\r\n\r\nconst msg = web3.sha3(hexData, { encoding: 'hex' }).slice(2)\r\n\r\nconst signature = web3.eth.sign(accounts[0], msg).slice(2)\r\n\r\nconst r = '0x' + signature.slice(0,64);\r\nconst s = '0x' + signature.slice(64, 128);\r\nconst v = Number.parseInt(signature.slice(128, 130), 16) + 27;\r\n```\r\n\r\nLater transaction could look like:\r\n```js\r\nawait token.sendByCheque(_operator, _nonce, v, r, s)\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Operator as smart contract which is accepting cheques\r\nIf user needs more control and don't want allow operator dispose of all his balance, there could be smart contract which do send tokens as users operator but only by accepting cheques.\r\n\r\nSuch smart contract could look like this:\r\n```solidity\r\ncontract ChequeBouncer {\r\n      using ECRecovery for bytes32;\r\n\r\n      function signerOfCheque(address _to, uint256 _amount, uint256 _fee, bytes _data) private returns (address) {\r\n          return keccak256(_to, _amount, _fee, _data).toEthSignedMessageHash().recover(_sig);\r\n      }\r\n}\r\n\r\ncontract ChequeOperator is ChequeBouncer {\r\n\r\n    ERC777Token public token; \r\n    mapping(address => mapping(address => uint256)) public paidChequeSum;\r\n\r\n    constructor(address _token) public {\r\n        token = ERC777Token(_token);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    function sendByCheque(address _to, uint256 _amount, uint256 _fee, bytes _data, bytes _sig) public returns (bool) {\r\n         require(_to != address(this));\r\n\r\n         // Check if signature is valid, remember last running sum\r\n         address signer = signerOfCheque(_to, _amount, _fee, _data, _sig);\r\n         require(signer != address(0));\r\n\r\n         uint256 amount = _amount.sub(paidChequeSum[signer][_to]).sub(_fee);\r\n         require(amount > 0);\r\n\r\n         if (amount > token.balances[signer]) {\r\n             amount = token.balances[signer].sub(_fee);\r\n         }\r\n\r\n        // Increase already paid amount\r\n        paidChequeSum[signer][_to] = paidChequeSum[signer][_to].add(amount);\r\n\r\n        // Send tokens\r\n        token.operatorSend(signer, _to, amount, _data, \"\");\r\n        token.operatorSend(signer, msg.sender, _fee, \"\", \"\");\r\n\r\n        return true;\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Use case\r\nI think this kind of cheques could potentially be widely used. Example use-case:\r\n\r\nImagine situation where shop gives discount points for client in a form of tokens. Also client downloads special app which is not only loyalty app but also is some kind of wallet and stores private key.\r\n\r\nLater, when client will want to use such points, without depositing some amount of gwei into his 'token wallet', he will not be able to transfer tokens. Meanwhile this token wallet could sign cheque and transfer it to shop back. Then shop (or some another entity) using this cheque could transfer tokens while paying for gas by himself.\r\n",

In the model proposed here, everyone can sign a cheque (to allow spending on their behalf), and anybody can redeem (in practice there are use cases when only a few addresses will redeem - see my example above with one-time addresses - but that's not explicitly constrained by the model).\r\n\r\nThe `onlyOwner` thus seems superfluous for the cheque model, as there's no need for a central authority to create a whitelist.

    "body": "Sure! I should have elaborated more, sorry. The model would definitely be different than the \"off chain whitelist\" approach that Signature Bouncer takes, but the concept of \"sign a permission for taking a future action with certain arguments\" fits in well. Perhaps a `ChequeBouncer` that verifiers amounts and signers?\r\n\r\nIt would be something like\r\n\r\n```solidity\r\ncontract ChequeBouncer {\r\n  using ECRecovery for bytes32;\r\n\r\n  // only verify signer, this contract, and amount. this hash where you'd add a nonce\r\n  function signerOfCheque(uint256 _amount, bytes _sig)\r\n    private\r\n    returns (address)\r\n  {\r\n    return keccak256(\r\n        address(this),\r\n        _amount,\r\n      )\r\n      .toEthSignedMessageHash()\r\n      .recover(_sig);\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\ncontract MyToken is ERC777, ChequeBouncer {\r\n  // allows anyone with signature to collect _amount tokens from signer and send them to _to\r\n  function sendByCheque(address _to, uint256 _amount, bytes _sig)\r\n    public\r\n  {\r\n    address signer = signerOfCheque(_amount, _sig);\r\n    require(signer != address(0));\r\n    doSend(signer, _to, _amount);\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe \"gassless tx with Operator\" pattern is also a good use-case for Signature Bouncer. Imagine a Proxy contract that allows anyone to call it with a meta transaction, but only if that metatransaction is signed by the owner (bouncer) of that proxy.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n(although if you'd like to guarantee the checks by making the committed funds unspendable until cashed, issuing that commitment to the cheque on-chain is necessary)",

The point of one-time addresses is legacy support for clients (i.e. wallets or custodian exchange accounts) that don't allow for customization of the token transfer data. I expect that client/wallet support for ERC777 will take quite a bit to mature, and an intermediate solution (such as `sendByCheque` can fill in the adoption time gap and enable the merchants accept payments from legacy clients while providing a mechanism for associating the payments with an invoice.",

    "body": "After some considerations I see that there is one more fix needed for `ChecqueOperator`.\r\n\r\nIf we're using `paidChequeSum` which accumulates sum we should not use data, because any of cheques could be skipped. So `data` can't be parameter of `sendByCheque` because some datas could be skipped.\r\n\r\nTo solve this problem we could add some kind of `agreements` functionality:\r\n```solidity\r\n\r\ncontract ChequeOperator is ChequeBouncer {\r\n\r\n    ERC777Token public token; \r\n    struct Agreement {\r\n        uint256 totalPaid;\r\n        address payer;\r\n        address beneficiary;\r\n        bytes data;\r\n    }\r\n    mapping(bytes32 => Agreement) public agreements;\r\n\r\n    constructor(address _token) public {\r\n        token = ERC777Token(_token);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    function createAgreement(bytes32 _id, address _payer, address _beneficiary, bytes _data) {\r\n        require(_beneficiary != address(0));\r\n        require(_payer != address(0));\r\n        require(agreements[_id].beneficiary == address(0));\r\n        agreements[_id] = Agreement({\r\n            totalPaid: 0,\r\n            payer: _payer,\r\n            beneficiary: _beneficiary,\r\n            data: _data\r\n        });\r\n    } \r\n\r\n    function sendByCheque(bytes32 _agreementId, uint256 _amount, uint256 _fee, bytes _sig) public returns (bool) {\r\n         // Check if agreement exists\r\n         Agreement storage agreement = agreements[_agreementId];\r\n         require(agreement.beneficiary != address(0));\r\n\r\n         // Check if signature is valid, remember last running sum\r\n         address signer = signerOfCheque(_agreementId, _amount, _fee, _sig);\r\n         require(signer == agreement.payer);\r\n\r\n         // Calculate amount of tokens to be send\r\n         uint256 amount = _amount.sub(agreement.totalPaid).sub(_fee);\r\n         require(amount > 0);\r\n\r\n         // If signer has less tokens that asked to transfer, we can transfer as much as he has already\r\n         // and rest tokens can be transferred via same cheque but in another tx \r\n         // when signer will top up his balance.\r\n         if (amount > token.balances[signer]) {\r\n             amount = token.balances[signer].sub(_fee);\r\n         }\r\n\r\n        // Increase already paid amount\r\n        agreement.totalPaid = agreement.totalPaid.add(amount);\r\n\r\n        // Send tokens\r\n        token.operatorSend(signer, agreement.beneficiary, amount, agreement.data, \"\");\r\n       \r\n        if (_fee > 0) {\r\n            token.operatorSend(signer, msg.sender, _fee, \"\", \"\");\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        return true;\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nI like this idea but it's good only for frequent token sends among two sides for similar purpose (agreement). Also it could be implemented in many way. Token standard don't need to have any knowledge about that. It's just my suggestion.\r\n\r\nIt's not very good for @meronym usecase. So let's have in `ERC965` two functions: \r\n\r\n```solidity\r\n    function authorizeOperatorBySignature(address _operator, uint256 _nonce, bytes _sig) public;\r\n    function sendBySignature(address _to, uint256 _amount, bytes _data, uint256 _nonce, bytes _sig) public;\r\n```\r\n\r\nI also propose to change `cheque` into `signature`, because `cheque` is something associated with money and not with paper which setting permissions.\r\n\r\nThere are no fee in `sendBySignature` because it should be part of `ChequeOperator` smart contract and is not needed for one shot sends.",
