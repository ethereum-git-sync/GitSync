Transferring the token composition means transferring the entire hierarchy of items. For example, a cryptokitty may own a scratching post and a feeding dish; the dish may contain some amount of fungible “chow” tokens. If I sell the cryptokitty, I sell all of the belongings of the cryptokitty.\r\n\r\n**Specification**\r\nAfter several discussions with the community we settled on providing these 4 extensions to a standard ERC-721 NFT in order to support composable functionality:\r\n\r\nERC998ERC721 top-down composable tokens that receive, hold and transfer ERC721 tokens\r\nERC998ERC20 top-down composable tokens that receive, hold and transfer ERC20 tokens\r\nERC998ERC721 bottom-up composable tokens that attach themselves to other ERC721 tokens.\r\nERC998ERC20 bottom-up composable tokens that attach themselves to ERC721 tokens.\r\n\r\nFor more details on the reference implementation, visit the EIP.\r\n\r\n**Summary**\r\n\r\nI’ve presented a new standard for composable non-fungible tokens, ERC-998, that allows for the ownership of ERC-998, ERC-721 and ERC-20 tokens. This allows standard assets to be composed into complex compositions and traded using a single transfer. The additional functionality that can be added to a non-fungible token based on the presence of specific child tokens is open for exploration. I believe that standard interfaces for non-fungible and fungible assets to be composed and act upon one another is an exciting new area for the Ethereum community to explore and I look forward to seeing the work.\r\n\r\n**LATEST: EIP with reference implementation code**\r\n\r\n[eip-998.md](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-998.md)",

    "body": "I see your point about the child tokenId being overwritten, that's a pain.\r\n\r\nI had several approaches to this and I knew this wasn't perfect. You are right that a child contract will only be able to have one ERC-721 child. Darn.\r\n\r\nA strict requirement of this proposal will be NOT requiring any changes to children that are already ERC-721 or ERC-20, meaning they won't have to upgrade to be a child of a composite.\r\n\r\nAnother approach was to keep the mapping:\r\n```\r\nmapping(uint256 => mapping(address => uint256));\r\n```\r\nAnd upgrade to a pseudo unique address for ERC-721 children:\r\n```\r\n// generate a unique address for ERC-721 child tokens\r\n// from _childContract and _childTokenId\r\naddress childToken = address(keccak256(_childContract, _childTokenId));\r\n// everything successful and you want to add the child token\r\n// use the unique address\r\nchildren[_tokenId][childToken] = _childTokenId;\r\n```\r\nNote: this is actually how the EVM generates smart contract addresses, using the hash of address + nonce as a bytes20 address type.\r\n\r\nIn this way we have a pseudo unique address for every child token.\r\n\r\nWe will have to adopt your bookkeeping method 0 means no child and 1 means child exists.\r\n\r\nI really wanted to reduce the need for a deep mapping as in your proposed solution, although my unique address generation pushes a bit more computation and gas fees onto the miners and users.\r\n\r\nThis would have to be calculated to transfer a child token as well, like so:\r\n```\r\naddress childToken = address(keccak256(_childContract, _childTokenId));\r\n// other conditions\r\nrequire(children[_tokenId][childToken] == 1); //0 is false and 1 is true for non-fungible tokens\r\n// transfer child here if other conditions check out\r\nchildren[_tokenId][childToken] = 0;\r\n```\r\nThoughts on this @mryellow?",

It's always this bit where you have to start thinking about using \"tokenId\" index `0` or returning \"tokenId\" `1` as \"true\", which all ends up feeling more untidy then was the intention.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the neatest solution is to not attempt to deal with them in the same variable, but storing differently once you know what type you're dealing with. Not sure how best to represent anything like that semantically though. Could add a boolean for `fungible` to any methods where `tokenId/value` appears to select between them, though that's not exactly neat either.",

The ERC does not impose any restrictions saying that certain values for key should only be used for certain things. Rather this is something that the community is free to experiment with.

There are also a lot of already existing naming conventions for claims that are in use today and coming up with our own standard might limit the ability for these to be used.\r\n\r\nHaving a `key` with a construction recipe for fungibles and non-fungibles which is consistent might be something worth looking at.

    "body": "This is a great start, thanks. Like the idea of pseudo-addresses for child tokens. Have a bunch of thoughts. Here're three major points.\r\n\r\n1. Mixed token types in one mapping.\r\n\r\n> Could be possible to go with a completely new mapping for non-fungibles and deal with them seperately.\r\n\r\nAs you said, I think this is a preferred solution. I don't think it's a good idea to have one mapping for two different standards. It adds complexity (and fragility), adds unexpected behaviors, makes it harder for the wallets to process two different types. Wallets actually don't know the type beforehand - how would they know what token is that without guessing that through presence of the methods, etc? To me that's the biggest problem that I don't see how to resolve without splitting. Token type needs to be defined very explicitly.\r\n\r\nSo fungiblePossessions and nonfungiblePossessions may be more appropriate, with comments explicitly saying what standards to they support (ERC20+ERC677 and ERC721 respectively).\r\n\r\n2. Currently it requires two transactions to pass ownership. This is very old-school :) ERC721 supports safeTransferFrom with onERC721Received callback (that needs to be implemented by this standard). ERC20 unfortunately doesn't and ERC223 is not backwards compatible with ERC20. But there's a nice [ERC677](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/677) addition to ERC20 that keeps it backward compatible while adding transferAndCall and tokenFallback pair similarly to described for 721 above. All the key exchanges already support that and this token should also support the callbacks. This is very critical to avoid two transactions per transfer, a bane of many early tokens.\r\n\r\n3. There has to be a way to enumerate all the children. Otherwise you have the wallets problem again, now for list of possessions. ERC721 actually implementa it, see [ERC721Enumerable](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-721.md) (which should really [not be optional](https://github.com/ethereum/eips/issues/721#issuecomment-383447697)). The way it works is we maintain both the hashing for retrieval/checks (to see if it holds this particular token) but also an array to be able to get a token by index. Then you just iterate till you hit 0. That also gives you numberOfChildren that is missing right now completely from the spec. To avoid loops in the smart contract we will need to smartly update the array and keep indices. See how Decentraland did it [in the storage](https://github.com/decentraland/erc721/blob/master/contracts/AssetRegistryStorage.sol) and then [in enumerable interface](https://github.com/decentraland/erc721/blob/master/contracts/ERC721Enumerable.sol).\r\n\r\nAlso, more like a suggestion. \"children\" naming sounds a bit off for ERC20. It's more like stuff that belongs to this token. Maybe possessions would be better, or something like that. Nit.",

    "body": "Hello everybody and thanks @mattlockyer for creating this ERC. I was thinking about something like this for over a month, happy to see it brought to attention of a broader community.\r\n\r\nMy initial idea was very similar to this, that you embed such functionality as an extension to ERC721, and your ERC998 contract would be an owner of some ERC721 tokens (from the perspective of owned token) while keeping information that the true owner is a token this contract itself keeps track of.\r\n\r\nI see some problems with such approach. The most important one being that if you have a chain of tokens from different ERC998 contracts, as a user you will have hard time understanding what contract you need to call to transfer a CryptoKitty that is owned by a DogERC998 token that is owned by PersonERC998 token that you own. I might be wrong here, but my intuition tells me you would have to call PersonERC998 and pass it 2 arrays of all contracts and tokens that are owners (parent, grandparent, ...) of the token to be able to retrieve that poor little Kitty.\r\n\r\nCurrently I'm thinking this is a perfect example where global / master registry could be used. I started drafting it ([code is here](https://github.com/Userfeeds/ERC721ComposableRegistries)) and would like to ask all of you if you also think this might be a good idea. I also agree with all the points @vernon99 mentioned and already partially incorporated them into the codebase.\r\nThe biggest advantage of using registry is that it will support CryptoKitty being owned by another CryptoKitty.",

I have been grinding through an implementation with tests so we have a basis from which to work on finding the most optimal solutions together.\r\n\r\n@vernon99 I have address the first 2 concerns for nonfungible \"possessions\".

    "body": "> I do foresee some issues with functionality, specific implementations that restrict the composability of assets for example.\r\n\r\nYes, there are things that need to be taken care of in 998. I can think of these cases:\r\n\r\n* once possession is attached to 998, it may want to not be transferable; this can be implemented overriding `ERC721::transferFrom` to always revert and making sure 998 always calls this function even if that meant to transfer 721 token from itself to itself when changing which 998 owns it.\r\n* possession may want to be attached only to certain kinds of 998s. This could be handled with some kind of callback (e.g. `onAttachedTo(address erc998, uint tokenId)`) to extended 721 that is aware of 998 and allowing attachment if function does not exist on 721.\r\n* 998 may want to own only certain kinds of possessions. This is the easiest to implement with local 998, but the global registry could call another callback (e.g. `onAttachedChild(address erc721, uint tokenId)`) and also accept if function is not there.",

    "body": "Hi everyone! Myself, @flockonus and a few other folks from the CryptoKitties team had the opportunity to meet @mattlockyer a couple days ago to discuss designs for composable NFTs. We primarily discussed a different design than what is currently in this ERC, which I’ll summarize here to get feedback on from all of you fine NFT enthusiasts!\r\n\r\n### Current Design Issues\r\n#### Ownership state is split between child/parent\r\nWhen a token is owned by a composable “parent” NFT, the complete ownership state is split between the child contract and the parent contract. The child contract (which may not know about ERC998) state says that the token is owned by the parent contract address. The parent contract specifies _which_ NFT within the contract _actually_ owns the child token. Similarly, sometimes methods related to ownership are executed from the child contract and other times they are executed from the parent contract.\r\nWith the bottom-up approach, all ownership state and associated methods would be implemented in the child.\r\n#### Implementation Complexity\r\nBasically, the current design requires implementors to maintain a lot of state! Parent contracts would need to track who owns their tokens, which child tokens are owned by the parent contract’s tokens, and reimplement/wrap `transfer`s and the like for these child tokens. With a bottom-up approach, all ownership state and methods would be compartmentalized in the contract responsible for the given token.\r\n#### Ownership terminology overloading\r\nOwnership in Ethereum is currently strongly defined as a mapping from Ethereum addresses to tokens of some kind. Current contracts rely on this relationship for ownership operations (you `transfer` an ERC20 token to a native Ethereum address). Since being backwards-compatible with this existing notion of ownership is not possible for composable tokens, we suggested being explicit about the semantic difference between the two notions of ownership by naming them differently. We suggested maintaining the `own` verb for ERC20/ERC721-style ownership, and using something else (maybe `link` or `attach`?) for when an NFT “owns” some other token.\r\n\r\n### Bottom-up Design Proposal\r\nThe current proposal describes ERC721 tokens with logic added so they can own child tokens. The bottom-up design inverts this, instead proposing an extension to ERC721 *and* ERC20/223 that enables them to be linked/attached to any ERC721 token, in addition to being owned by an Ethereum address (as is the case now). \r\n\r\nSimilarly to the current proposal, the ownership hierarchy for a particular NFT can be thought of as a tree, with an Ethereum address at the root, NFTs in the middle, and either NFTs or fungible tokens at the leaves.\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10557821/41802705-a93fb5c4-7637-11e8-9c88-f9cf951afb8d.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Rationale\r\nIn addition to the benefits in the next section, the rationale behind this proposal comes from our experience with CryptoKitties. After releasing CryptoKitties, many developers built apps, tools, and tokens that extend the CryptoKitties ecosystem. It doesn’t make much sense for a CryptoKitty to own EOS tokens, but it _does_ make sense (and is super cool!) for a CryptoKitty to own a provably unique cat-hat token (see [KittyHats](https://kittyhats.co/#/)). In general, we see value in NFTs being extended by contextual tokens with semantic meaning, not NFTs being able to own arbitrary tokens. We think the bottom-up approach best fits this ecosystem-extension view of composable tokens.\r\n\r\n### Benefits\r\n*  ownership logic is compartmentalized in the child contract, where the ownership logic already is\r\n* Since ownership logic and state is maintained in one place, implementation complexity is much lower\r\n* any NFTs (including already deployed NFTs) can be parents and “own” child tokens\r\n\r\n### Drawbacks\r\n* generic on-chain enumerability of children is not possible. However, off-chain enumerability is possible using events, and on-chain enumerability is possible for specific child types on a per-contract basis.",

    "body": "I have been looking into the bottom-up approach.  Some comments:\r\n\r\nUsing the bottom-up approach it is possible for new composable-aware ERC721 parent contracts to have onchain enumeration for any token that is transferred to it. This is done by using the `safeTransferFrom` and the `onERC721Received` functions to pass into the parent contract the child tokenId. And when the child contract transfers itself out of the parent it should make a call to the parent contract to remove itself.\r\n\r\nI really like the idea of doing enumeration off-chain because I don't like the expense and complexity of the bookkeeping on-chain.\r\n\r\nI like the idea of using events to track child tokens of parents. A cache of this info (child tokens) could be included in the JSON file returned by the tokenURI for each parent.\r\n\r\nThere is another issue which is buy/trade/sales verification of state. When selling a parent token the state of the parent token (all the children) can be checked using on-chain enumeration to verify it is all that is expected by the buyer. This verification can be done in the same transaction that the transfer is done. Without this verification it is possible for someone to remove children right before a transfer call and the buyer does not get what he/she paid for.\r\n\r\nSo my question is this: How to securely do state verification of a parent ERC721 token when selling it if there is no on-chain enumeration? \r\n\r\nPerhaps the state verification can be done onchain by passing in an array of child contracts and child token Ids to check for after the transfer function is called. I think that would work.",

    "body": ">Does a cat continue to be attached to a hat after the hat's ownership has changed?\r\n>Who can detach the hat?\r\n\r\n@mryellow I believe that's the intention, the hat would keep on belonging to the same cat. Who can detach the item is the current owner of the cat.\r\n\r\n> So my question is this: How to securely do state verification of a parent ERC721 token when selling it if there is no on-chain enumeration?\r\n> Perhaps the state verification can be done onchain by passing in an array of child contracts and child token Ids to check for after the transfer function is called. I think that would work.\r\n\r\n@mudgen  I think so too! If the item in case that is for purchase, has attached items that are important for the buyer then it would make sense that the purchase order would pass an array of address+ids to verify the items are indeed attached to the NFT.\r\n\r\nIt would work with signed transactions (similar to 0x style) orders as well, if the seller at the time of the sales creation also bundle the promise of the items in the order.",

    "body": "@flockonus @mudgen https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/1180 proposes a generic solution for validation when selling NFTs.\r\n\r\n> Using the bottom-up approach it is possible for new composable-aware ERC721 parent contracts to have onchain enumeration for any token that is transferred to it. This is done by using the safeTransferFrom and the onERC721Received functions to pass into the parent contract the child tokenId. And when the child contract transfers itself out of the parent it should make a call to the parent contract to remove itself.\r\n\r\n@mudgen I think your assumptions are wrong here. If I understand this bottom-up concept correctly, child token is never directly transferred to its parent, i.e. `childContract.ownerOf(someTokenId) != parentContract` is true, unless someone just sent a token to a contract using `transferFrom` and basically burned it.\r\n\r\n@jordanschalm @flockonus Are you going to join our next composable call on NFTy Magicians discord? I would like to discuss this concept with you in depth and believe we should schedule a call sooner than planned. Also @jordanschalm I asked you some questions there, but if you want I can move it to GitHub.",
