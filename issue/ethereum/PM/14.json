    "body": "Another item: I am starting to get cold feet about the REVERT opcode being able to return data. My main concern is that it will break any applications that depend on being able to micro-charge for getting data. I do realize that such applications are not extremely secure in any case because the fee can always be circumvented via merkle proof magic, but even still such strategies always have some cost, and so there is opportunity for applications to be able to charge at least enough to pay back any fixed costs they have for transaction fees. I'm concerned that (i) we are introducing an economic change which breaks things, and that (ii) the marginal benefits of knowing why an error happened may not be worth the costs.",

Once EIPs are frozen for Metropolis, any change in the EIP that changes test cases needs to go through the All Core Devs meeting with the unanimous vote (it's meant to be hard, but not impossible, to achieve).\r\n\r\nAs an effect, when a frozen EIP has a critical problem, but if any party says they have not enough time to test the fix, the EIP would be dropped from Metropolis.\r\n\r\nThe first question is if we shall try to have this distinction \"frozen\".  (Implementation details should come afterward: e.g. how to keep track of the frozen states; which EIPs to freeze first; shall we set the minimum duration between freeze and activation.)",
