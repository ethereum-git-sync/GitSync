As context, we operate a digital currency exchange that has supported ethereum since early 2016.\r\n\r\nI just went through the meeting notes for meeting 35 and have some thoughts:\r\n- first of all, thank you so much for posting these notes. They are incredibly useful\r\n- more frequent/smaller hard forks are probably very nice for a development team, but not as great for the rest of the community. In 2016 when the network was attacked, we really struggled with operations, customer communication, etc... right now ethereum forks are big news so there’s significant exposure, news translation (our customers don’t speak English) and it makes thing easier(ish), having them very frequent would be harder for us\r\n- please please please don’t get rid of the geth console. It’s absolutely priceless and incredibly valuable to us\r\n\r\nThanks and keep up the amazing work!",
