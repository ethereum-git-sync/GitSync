And is it about the same thing as you describe in that EIP?\r\n\r\nI assume you might be thinking of the \"[Make EIP 1559 more like an AMM curve](https://ethresear.ch/t/make-eip-1559-more-like-an-amm-curve/9082)\" proposal? Or maybe some similar proposal.\r\n\r\nI'd argue those are orthogonal to this EIP: The EIP modifies the signal used for the base fee update (how full was the last block? how full should it have been?), whereas these proposals by Vitalik & co deal with how to update the base fee given a specific signal. I also have some thoughts on the latter, but decided to keep them out of the EIP to really make it single-purpose.",
