It appears to be desirable to have something like this in place already for the merge, to avoid (or at least greatly reduce) throughput degradation due to missed slots, or even due to potential consensus issues.\r\n\r\nTo maximize the chance of this EIP being included in the merge fork, the adjustments are kept to a minimum, with more involved changes discussed in the rationale section.",
