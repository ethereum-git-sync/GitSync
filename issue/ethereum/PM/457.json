Unlike the renaming of `SELFDESTRUCT`, and other similar proposed renamings, this is not merely a change of name but also a change of function.  As such, presenting the wrong name could be misleading; this is the reason I am somewhat uncomfortable with simply picking one of the two names, because it would not correctly describe the function in the other cases.\r\n2. Displaying the correct name requires knowing the EVM version, information which is not always available.\r\n3. If the output of such a tool is to be fed into something else, it may not be acceptable to use a hybrid like `DIFFICULTY/RANDOM`.",
