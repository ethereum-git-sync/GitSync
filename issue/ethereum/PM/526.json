    "body": "We considered a small validator set for Sepolia but didn't want to miss the chance to have a new beaconchain with a large genesis set. The main reason is that in order to expand Prater to 2xmainnet we'd need to perform a non-insigificant number of deposits with an increasingly reducing supply of goerli ether. By making the Sepolia beaconchain much larger, we can stop trying to increase the validator set on Prater and reserve that goerli ether for other purposes.\r\n\r\nIf we're fine continuing to increase the prater validator set size, then I agree that we can have a small network for sepolia that's a lot easier to run.  \r\n\r\n",
