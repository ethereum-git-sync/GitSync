    "body": "I won't make the call today. Some updates:\r\n\r\n- Two evm fuzzers are (still) running. No new issues found in the last couple of weeks. \r\n- One testcase found by fuzzing has now been added to the tests-repo. It affected geth and ethereumJ (at least), and concerned `EXTCODEHASH` in a fairly complex edgcase scenario. \r\n-   Hive is currently down for maintenance, I have some hopes that we'll get it working again during the day. Hive has been moved into the ethereum org (https://github.com/ethereum/hive/), and a new geth-team member @FrankSzendzielarz have been working on improving it further, with a test-suite for p2p networking as well as support for more advanced multi-cllient test suites. \r\n",
