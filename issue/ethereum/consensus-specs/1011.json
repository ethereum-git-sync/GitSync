  "body": "# ETH2.0 Beacon Node & Validator Client RPC Proposal\r\n\r\n## Outline\r\n\r\nThis issue proposes a minimal communications specification between a beacon node and validator client, targeting _phase 0_ of the Eth2.0 specification. The protocol is designed to be a simple local communications interface, permitting two separate binaries to communicate.\r\n\r\nThis specification is intended to describe communication abstractly, without choosing any particular protocol. The protocol used (e.g. gRPC/JSON-RPC) is discussed in a separate issue: #1012.\r\n\r\nThis issue follows on from a discussion during the [Client Architecture](https://notes.ethereum.org/iuPB2YjKQMGua0nwCZJVAQ) session at the [Sydney Implementers meeting](https://notes.ethereum.org/7w7diW1-St2_Yu-YHjg6NA). This also follow from the [Client Architecture Roundtable](https://hackmd.io/s/rJl05Lk6X) in Prague.\r\nThere is an editable version of this document, here: https://hackmd.io/r7D61hs4RWKm8nz_O2iinQ\r\n\r\n###  Background\r\nThe beacon node maintains the state of the beacon chain by communicating with other beacon nodes in the Ethereum Serenity network. Conceptually, it does not maintain keypairs that participate with the beacon chain.\r\n\r\nThe validator client is conceptually a separate entity which utilises private keys to perform validator related tasks on the beacon chain, which we call validator \"duties\". This includes the production of beacon blocks and signing of attestations.\r\n\r\nSince it is recommended to separate these concerns in the client implementations, it is necessary for us to clearly define the communication between them.\r\n\r\nThe goal of this specification is to promote interoperability between beacon nodes and validator clients derived from different projects. For example, the validator client from Lighthouse, could communicate with a running instance of the beacon node from Prysm.\r\n\r\nThis proposal has been adapted from the [Lighthouse gRPC protocol specification](https://github.com/sigp/lighthouse/blob/master/protos/src/services.proto).\r\n\r\nThere is also another [WIP proposal for a Minimum Validator Interface](https://notes.ethereum.org/Ia2kvjy0RX2J-GxrWfoCAQ), which describes additional functions possibly necessary for phase 1 and beyond.\r\n\r\n## Specification \r\n\r\n### Entities \r\nThe following are the two entities that participate in this protocol:\r\n - **`BeaconNode`**:\r\n A beacon node instance, run with a `--rpc` flag to enable the RPC interface. Runs stand-alone.\r\n\r\n - **`ValidatorClient`**:\r\nA validator client instance, which must connect to at least one instance of `BeaconNode`.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Endpoints\r\nThis section summarises API endpoints which are published by an instance of `BeaconNode`, for the exclusive use of `ValidatorClient` implementations.\r\n \r\nThis proposal is a minimum set of messages necessary to enable effective communication, without any extra features. Anything extra is beyond the scope of this document.\r\n\r\n#### Summary Table\r\n| Name      | Type | Parameters |  Returns |  \r\n| --------  | ---  | -----      |  -----   | \r\n| [`get_client_version`](#get_client_version) | GET | N/A        |  `client_version` | \r\n| [`get_genesis_time`](#get_genesis_time) | GET | N/A        |  `genesis_time` | \r\n| [`get_syncing_status`](#get_syncing_status) | GET | N/A        |  `syncing_status` | \r\n| [`get_duties`](#get_duties) | GET | `validator_pubkeys` |  `syncing_status`, `current_version`, [`ValidatorDuty`]| \r\n| [`produce_block`](#produce_block) | GET | `slot`, `randao_reveal` | `beacon_block` | \r\n| [`publish_block`](#publish_block) | POST |  `beacon_block` |  N/A  | \r\n| [`produce_attestation`](#produce_attestation) | GET | `slot`, `shard` |  `indexed_attestation` | \r\n| [`publish_attestation`](#publish_attestation) | POST | `indexed_attestation` | N/A | Publishes the IndexedAttestation after having been signed by the ValidatorClient |\r\n\r\n#### Status Codes\r\nFor each of these endpoints the underlying transport protocol should provide status codes. Assuming this will be based on HTTP, one of the following standard status codes will always be included as part of a response:\r\n\r\n| Code | Meaning |\r\n| ---  | ---     |\r\n| `200`  | The API call succeeded. |\r\n| `40X`  | The request was malformed.   |\r\n| `500`  | The `BeaconNode` cannot complete the request due to an internal error. |\r\n| `503`  | The `BeaconNode` is currently syncing, try again later. _A call can be made to `get_syncing_status` to in order to find out how much has been synchronised._ |\r\n\r\n#### `get_client_version`\r\nRequests that the `BeaconNode` identify information about its implementation in a format similar to a [HTTP User-Agent](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231#section-5.5.3) field.\r\n\r\n - **Parameters**: N/A\r\n - **Returns**:\r\n \r\n | Name         | Type          | Description |\r\n | ---          | ---              | --- |\r\n | `client_version`  | bytes32 | An ASCII-encoded hex string which uniquely defines the implementation of the `BeaconNode` and its current software version. |\r\n \r\n **Note**: _Unlike most other endpoints, `get_client_version` does not return an error `503` while the `BeaconNode` is syncing, but instead returns status code `200`._\r\n\r\n\r\n#### `get_genesis_time`\r\n Requests the `genesis_time` parameter from the `BeaconNode`, which should be consistent across all `BeaconNodes` that follow the same beacon chain.\r\n \r\n - **Parameters**: N/A\r\n - **Returns**:\r\n \r\n | Name         | Type          | Description |\r\n | ---          | ---              | --- |\r\n | `genesis_time`  | uint64 | The [`genesis_time`](https://github.com/ethereum/eth2.0-specs/blob/dev/specs/core/0_beacon-chain.md#on-genesis), which is a fairly static configuration option for the `BeaconNode`. |\r\n \r\n **Note**: _Unlike most other endpoints, `get_genesis_time` does not return an error `503` while the `BeaconNode` is syncing, but instead returns status code `200`._\r\n\r\n\r\n#### `get_syncing_status`\r\n Requests the `BeaconNode` to describe if it's currently syncing or not, and if it is, what block it is up to. This is modelled after the Eth1.0 JSON-RPC [`eth_syncing`](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/JSON-RPC#eth_syncing) call.\r\n  - **Parameters**: N/A\r\n - **Returns**:\r\n \r\n | Name         | Type          | Description |\r\n | ---          | ---              | --- |\r\n | `syncing`  | `false` OR `SyncingStatus` | Either `false` if the node is not syncing, or a [`SyncingStatus`](#SyncingStatus) object if it is. |\r\n \r\n  **Note**: _Unlike most other endpoints, `get_syncing_status` does not return an error `503` while the `BeaconNode` is syncing, but instead returns status code `200` with the `SyncingStatus` object._\r\n \r\n\r\n#### `get_duties`\r\n  Requests the BeaconNode to provide a set of “duties”, which are actions that should be performed by ValidatorClients. This API call should be polled at every slot, to ensure that any chain reorganisations are catered for, and to ensure that the currently connected `BeaconNode` is properly synchronised.\r\n  \r\n - **Parameters**: \r\n \r\n | Name                 | Type      | Description   | \r\n | ---                  | ---       |  ---          |\r\n | `validator_pubkeys`  | [bytes48] | A list of unique validator public keys, where each item is a `0x` encoded hex string. |\r\n \r\n - **Returns**:\r\n \r\n | Name                 | Type              | Description   |\r\n | ---                  | ---               | ---           |\r\n | `current_version`    | bytes4            | The `current_version`, as described by the current [`Fork`](#Fork). |\r\n | `validator_duties`   | [`ValidatorDuty`] | A list where each item is a custom [`ValidatorDuty`](#ValidatorDuty) object. |\r\n \r\n \r\n #### `produce_block`\r\n Requests a `BeaconNode` to produce a valid block, which can then be signed by a ValidatorClient.\r\n \r\n - **Parameters**: \r\n \r\n | Name             | Type      | Description |\r\n | ---              | ---       | --- |\r\n | `slot`           | uint64    | The slot for which the block should be proposed. |\r\n | `randao_reveal`  | bytes     | The ValidatorClient's randao reveal value. |\r\n \r\n - **Returns**:\r\n \r\n | Name             | Type          | Description |\r\n | ---              | ---           | --- |\r\n | `beacon_block`   | `BeaconBlock` | A proposed [`BeaconBlock`](#BeaconBlock) object, but with the `signature` field left blank.\r\n \r\n \r\n #### `publish_block`\r\n Instructs the `BeaconNode` to publish a newly signed beacon block to the beacon network, to be included in the beacon chain.\r\n - **Parameters**: \r\n \r\n | Name             | Type      | Description |\r\n | ---              | ---       | --- |\r\n | `beacon_block`   | `BeaconBlock` | The [`BeaconBlock`](#BeaconBlock) object, as sent from the `BeaconNode` originally, but now with the `signature` field completed.\r\n \r\n - **Returns**: N/A\r\n \r\n \r\n ####  `produce_attestation`\r\n Requests that the `BeaconNode` produce an `IndexedAttestation`, with a blank `signature` field, which the `ValidatorClient` will then sign.\r\n \r\n - **Parameters**: \r\n \r\n | Name             | Type      | Description |\r\n | ---              | ---       | --- |\r\n | `slot`           | uint64    | The slot for which the attestation should be proposed. |\r\n | `shard`          | uint64    | The shard number for which the attestation is to be proposed. |\r\n \r\n - **Returns**:\r\n \r\n | Name             | Type          | Description |\r\n | ---              | ---           | --- |\r\n | `indexed_attestation`   | `IndexedAttestation` | An [`IndexedAttestation`](#IndexedAttestation) structure with the `signature` field left blank. |\r\n \r\n #### `publish_attestation`\r\n Instructs the `BeaconNode` to publish a newly signed `IndexedAttestation` object, to be incorporated into the beacon chain.\r\n \r\n - **Parameters**: \r\n \r\n | Name             | Type          | Description |\r\n | ---              | ---           | --- |\r\n | `indexed_attestation`   | `IndexedAttestation` | An [`IndexedAttestation`](#IndexedAttestation) structure, as originally provided by the `BeaconNode`, but now with the `signature` field completed. |\r\n  - **Returns**: N/A\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n -----\r\n\r\n### Data Structures\r\nTwo new data objects are proposed for the sake of implementation, and several other data objects from the Eth2.0 specs are referenced.\r\n\r\nThe `bytes` data types are encoded hex strings, with `0x` preceeding them. `uint64` are decimal encoded integers, and `None` may be `null`, which is distinct from `0`.\r\n\r\n#### `ValidatorDuty`\r\n```asm\r\n{\r\n    \r\n    # The validator's public key, uniquely identifying them\r\n    'validator_pubkey': 'bytes48',\r\n    # The index of the validator in the committee\r\n    'committee_index': 'uint64',\r\n    # The slot at which the validator must attest.\r\n    'attestation_slot': 'uint64',\r\n    # The shard in which the validator must attest\r\n    'attestation_shard': 'uint64',\r\n    # The slot in which a validator must propose a block.

    "body": "another option is that we define the interfaces such that the beacon node returns everything the validator client provides in the request, such that the response is a strict superset of the request.\r\n\r\nthis is kind of the route that (afaiui) graphQL takes, where a server will \"fill in the blanks\" for a given client.\r\n\r\ni would argue this is helpful for a few reasons (probably others):\r\n\r\n1. debuggability -- the complete packet of info can be in one place, rather than having to manually thread a request and response message\r\n2. safety -- this came to mind after reading: https://github.com/ethereum/eth2.0-specs/issues/1011#issuecomment-488041552; a payload of \"duties\" lacking the full context is dangerous imo. as a validator, i should know for which pubkeys i should perform which duties... the current suggestion assumes i'll keep an ordered list somewhere that i can check against which seems error prone in the case that (i) nodes cycle, (ii) i have a bug in my list-checking code, etc.\r\n3. backwards compatibility -- the fewer constraints we place on the API today, the less change will be necessary in the future\r\n\r\ni think this notion of safety is pretty important so i would extend the design principle across every API (and really this stands for any RPC we will define for the whole endeavor) -- the only downside is the additional communication overhead but i don't see it being that major",

I have two potentially interesting thoughts around this:\r\n\r\n### Searching for pubkeys in the validator registry\r\nLighthouse also found this `O(n)` search problem whilst bench-marking deposits processing at large numbers of validators (300k, 4M). When processing a `Deposit`, you need to do the same search through the `validator_registry` to see if the validator already exists. We found this was massively blowing-up our block processing times so we ended up including a [public key cache](https://github.com/sigp/lighthouse/blob/master/eth2/types/src/beacon_state/pubkey_cache.rs) with our `BeaconState`.\r\n\r\nAs a result, we have a map hanging around to do `O(1)` lookups of `pubkey -> validator index` which suits this purpose perfectly.\r\n\r\n### ID'ing validators via pubkey vs. validator index\r\n\r\nThere is an argument that we could use the `validator_index` as a canonical reference to a specific validator, but I'm a little cautious of it because it seems like we might face edge-cases or design decisions that break the invariant that it's impossible for the same `validator_index` to point to a different `pubkey`.\r\n\r\nGiven that a `pubkey` is a really solid unique-ID for a validator, I'm tempted to rely upon it. IIRC @djrtwo was leaning towards `validator_index` so maybe he'd like to throw a hat in the ring.\r\n\r\nOf course, I'm keen to hear other's thoughts too.",
