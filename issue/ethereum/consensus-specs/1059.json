  "body": "### Issue\r\nAll the SSZ objects in pyspec are [Pythonic-mutable](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/mutable-vs-immutable-objects-in-python/).\r\n* Pros: allowing us to update state easily\r\n* Cons: sometimes it causes an unexpected or undesirable effect\r\n\r\nFor example, if there is a fuzzing test case with two blocks: the first block is invalid and the second block is valid. Although during the first block state transition it raises `Exception`, the mutable `state` might be updated.\r\n\r\n### How to reduce the side effect:\r\n#### Option 1: Add protection in the `state_transition` function:\r\nIn #1018, the `state_transition` function is updated to:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/ethereum/eth2.0-specs/blob/4c1073fa2f898de7ffe26fd8aa197d38c25a8f35/specs/core/0_beacon-chain.md#beacon-chain-state-transition-function\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef state_transition(state: BeaconState, block: BeaconBlock) -> BeaconState:\r\n    # Process slots (including those with no blocks) since block\r\n    process_slots(state, block.slot)\r\n    # Process block\r\n    process_block(state, block)\r\n    # Return post-state\r\n    return state\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe can change it to:\r\n```python\r\ndef state_transition(state: BeaconState, block: BeaconBlock) -> BeaconState:\r\n    pre_state = copy.deepcopy(state)\r\n    try:\r\n        # Process slots (including those with no blocks) since block\r\n        process_slots(state, block.slot)\r\n        # Process block\r\n        process_block(state, block)\r\n        # Return post-state\r\n    except Exception:\r\n        return pre_state\r\n    else:\r\n        return state\r\n```\r\n\r\n* Pros: easiest way to hack this case\r\n* Cons: probably other cases may happen in the test suite that we don't know yet\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Option 2: Make all helper functions to be pure functions\r\nAdd `copy.deepcopy(state)` + return `state` in every helper function (maybe with decorator).\r\n\r\n* Pros: pure functions yay!\r\n* Cons: verbosity; it's possible that someone will forget to add it and cause other bugs\r\n\r\n#### Option 3: Immutable everything\r\nGenerally, that's what Trinity is doing.\r\n* Pros: it kills all side effect\r\n* Cons: verbosity\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nAlthough Option 1 might be good enough, I raise the possibility of other options here before the Frozen™️. 😄",
