    "body": "Agree there, don't know about the original rationale of the SSZ tests that were ported over. I don't think the ssz-generic is very useful at this point. When we want to ensure encoding/decoding *any* ssz structure, even outside of the spec, works, we'll extend the suite. For now I recommend to try and pass the the ssz-static suite (and honestly, if you pass that, chances of an edge case bug outside of the spec usage are incredibly small). Focus is on state-transition tests first :+1: \r\n",
