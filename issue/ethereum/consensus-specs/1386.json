  "body": "The beacon [fork choice rule](https://github.com/ethereum/eth2.0-specs/blob/dev/specs/core/0_fork-choice.md#get_head) currently does not use the (implicit) slot corresponding to an attestation (which can be computed using `get_attestation_data_slot`). This means that the beacon fork choice rule is discarding information about skip slots, and can be made more granular.\r\n\r\nThe suggested fix is to replace the `LatestMessage` container with:\r\n\r\n```\r\nclass BeaconCheckpoint(Container):\r\n    slot: Slot\r\n    root: Hash\r\n```\r\n\r\n(I.e. replace `epoch` with `slot`. For clarity, we could rename `Checkpoint`—e.g. to `FFGCheckpoint`, `EpochCheckpoint`, `FinalityCheckpoint`.) We then make `get_head` return a `BeaconCheckpoint` (as opposed to a plain `Hash`).\r\n\r\nIn addition to changing the fork choice rule, we could also replace `AttestationData. beacon_block_root` by a `BeaconCheckpoint` to make the slot explicit. This is something that @djrtwo suggested we do, and I now think it is the \"natural\" thing to do. (Part of the reason it is natural is that we want shard chains to vote on `ShardCheckpoint`s, not plain block roots which do not take into account skip slots.)",

    "body": "Good catch!\r\n\r\nI'm not certain there is value in introducing a new SSZ container into the `AttestationData`, especially named a `Checkpoint` in this case is it isn't really used to checkpoint anything.\r\n\r\nAlso, I think the granularity of `slot` for `LatestMessage` is incorrect. We want the epoch of the attestation slot rather than the granular slot. If the validator equivocates by making a message for a later slot in the same epoch, this second message for the same epoch should not override the prior fork choice vote. A vote should be the first vote in an epoch.\r\n\r\nI think we should do the following:\r\n\r\n* keep `LatestMessage` in the fork choice spec and keep it `epoch`-based\r\n* add `slot` to `AttestationData`, explicitly making the `slot` of the assigned committee available for quick lookups (when considering fork choice, slashing lookups, etc). This also will pair well with easily deciding if a fork choice vote is stale (wrt the fork choice change being proposed to solve the recent flip flop attack) without having to do state lookups\r\n* Assign `latest_message.epoch = compute_epoch_of_slot(attestation.data.slot)` and only update a validator's latest message if the epoch of the new_attestation slot is greater than the latest message",

    "body": "> the granularity of `slot` for `LatestMessage` is incorrect\r\n\r\nDisagree :) Consider the following situation. You have the genesis block `G` at slot 0, a block `B` at slot 1 (building on `G`), and a \"virtual\" skip block `S` also at slot 1 (building on `G`). You've received 3 attestations so far—1 attestation has GHOST vote for `B`, and 2 attestations have GHOST votes for `S`. Currently `get_head` returns `signing_root(B)`. This is incorrect. Instead, `get_head` should return `(Slot(1), signing_root(G))`.",
