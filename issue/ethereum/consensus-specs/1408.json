  "body": "An attestation contains three votes: LMD GHOST vote, FFG vote and Crosslink vote.\r\nThe beacon chain specs specify how to validate an attestation and its votes.\r\nHowever, the validation is split in several parts: some checks defined in [fork_choice/on_attestation](https://github.com/ethereum/eth2.0-specs/blob/dev/specs/core/0_fork-choice.md#on_attestation) and others - in [process_attestation](https://github.com/ethereum/eth2.0-specs/blob/dev/specs/core/0_beacon-chain.md#attestations). They both invoke [is_valid_indexed_attestation](https://github.com/ethereum/eth2.0-specs/blob/dev/specs/core/0_beacon-chain.md#is_valid_indexed_attestation).\r\n\r\nThe `on_attestation` deals mostly with LMD GHOST vote and part of FFG vote (`target` field). So, if there arrives an attestation with an invalid crosslink vote or an invalid `source` fields, then it is still accepted by the fork choice spec and affects the LMD GHOST fork choice.\r\nHowever, the attestation should not be included in newly proposed blocks, since it won't pass `process_attestation` checks (see [validator spec](https://github.com/ethereum/eth2.0-specs/blob/dev/specs/validator/0_beacon-chain-validator.md#attestations).\r\n\r\nWhile there may be reasons to split validation in two parts, this can lead to inconsistencies in fork choice. Consider a case, when there are two head candidates, both having the same amount of votes and tie break chooses the first one. If a partially correct attestation added, which votes for the second block, then the second block becomes the head, based on off-chain plus on-chain attestation. But since this last vote cannot be incorporated into the chain, from on-chain attestations perspective, the first candidate is the head. I do not fully understand consequences of the discrepancy, but it seems awkward at least.\r\n\r\nAnother example. If such a partially valid attestations is propagated only to part of the network nodes, it cannot reach other (honest) validators via proposed blocks, because of `process_attestation` assertion failures. It can result in different views on the state of the blockchain, which can be only corrected by propagating such invalid attestations to other nodes.\r\nSo this looks like a potential unnecessary source of forks, which can be exploited by an attacker.",

    "body": "There are multiple things to consider here:\r\n\r\nThere is a related thing with \"should we verify twice\"; I'm heavily opposed to doing a single-pass verification of the attestation for several reasons:\r\n- relying on your pool of operations is bad. Bitcoin Core had a bug where consensus was partially reliant on the mempool being validated (iirc).\r\n- the fork-choice is different from the state transition, since voting is not the only thing happening with attestation, more on this below. Fork-choice can just verify the format, and the weight, and it is valid enough.\r\n\r\nFork-choice accepting partially invalid attestations is not that bad. If an attestation has weight and is signed, it still helps determine the head. We shouldn't rely too much on full state details being available to process it in a large graph of forks.\r\nAnd if the attestation is really bad, it can be slashed. It having an invalid crosslink may hurt it for the attesters economical purposes as it won't get included on-chain, but it won't hurt the chain itself.\r\n",
