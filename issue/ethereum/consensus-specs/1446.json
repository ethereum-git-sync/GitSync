  "body": "This issue describes a feasible way to gain a dishonest majority in the first two epochs.\r\n\r\n### Assumptions\r\n- The shuffling of the first two epochs is determined only by the number of active validators (`v`).\r\n- `v` can only vary by at most `n`, where `n = eth1_gas_limit / gas_for_deposit` (I think this is ~100).\r\n\r\n### Gaining an early dishonest majority\r\n\r\nIf an attacker can control their index in the deposit tree (this seems feasible), then it would take `n * (SLOTS_PER_EPOCH / 2)` validators to ensure they control 50% of the validators in either the first or second epochs.\r\n\r\n### Implications\r\n\r\n#### Influencing future shuffling\r\n\r\nAn attacker with a block-producer majority gains the standard 1-bit of control by submitting/withholding a block.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, an attacker can also choose thier randao reveal (to some degree) by choosing their private key. Note that the attacker has a long time (now until genesis) to compute these private keys.\r\n\r\nSome rough calculations show that gaining _full_ control of future shufflings is infeasible, but _some_ degree of control is possible.\r\n\r\n#### Breaking eth1 linking\r\n\r\nIf used with above attack (influencing future shuffling), it may be feasible for the attacker to produce a majority of the blocks the `ETH1_VOTING_PERIOD` and break the eth1-linking.\r\n\r\nWe have not looked into the feasibility of this attack.\r\n\r\n### Additional Comments\r\n\r\nSetting `v` seems to be an instance of \"eth1 transaction ordering attack\" on smart contracts. Here are some ways to set `v`:\r\n\r\n- Be an eth1 miner and supress transactions.\r\n- Use known gas-war techniques to manipulate the ordering of deposits.\r\n  - `1 ether` deposits can be used to cheapen this attack.\r\n",

    "body": "As discussed, Paul and I agreed that the simplest way to avoid this attack is to use the `eth1_block_hash` as the initial `randao_mix` for the genesis state. Even if an attacker can control the sort of `v`, the attacker is not likely to have more than a few bits of influence on the given eth1 genesis block hash. Thus even if they can bias this initial shuffling, it won't be in such a magnitude that would be beneficial to carrying out the above attacks.",
