The cold key is that one that needs to be kept safe; keeping the hot key also offline doesn't add any security issues.  Really, both keys should be owned by the actual customer, with the hot key only being giving to the service so that they can act on behalf of the customer.\r\n\r\nAnother thing, if it is relevant, is checking the specs:\r\n* An Eth 1 deposit can be for a partial amount, so long as it is >= MIN_DEPOSIT_AMOUNT\r\n* The first time valid deposit data is received for pub key it creates a Validator, with that pub key and withdrawal key (but the validator isn't activated until it has the required amount)\r\n* Subsequent deposits for that pub key are added to the balance, even if the withdrawal key differs\r\n\r\nSo, while there could be multiple withdrawal keys on Eth 1 (e.g. two people share half the cost each), only one of them (the first) is recorded in Eth 2. I am not sure if this is intentional.\r\n\r\nEven if it was intentional (i.e. we go back to the deposit data for each part of the withdrawal), with multiple stakers backing one validator, the situation between half dual-key exit, pre-signed exit, and simply giving the customer the hot key is pretty much the same:\r\n\r\nEither the customer owns the full amount, so should have full access to the hot key; or it is shared between customers, and none of them should have access to unilaterally exit (certainly not the one who just happened to be first).\r\n\r\n",

    "body": "From the standpoint of a staking service, I would as much as possible not have a key I hold&use with a hardened system(HSM) be in the hand of an end-user or third-party service, that would go against securing SLA for the said end-user client.\r\n\r\nFrom the standpoint of a user, I would as much as possible prevent a third-party from behaving suboptimally (i.e: not meeting SLA) and I would most probably use another third-party service to ensure that the staking service provider I registered to doesn't go wild.\r\n\r\nAs of now, there is 3 possible actions (**attest**/**voluntarily exit**/**withdraw**) with only 2 types of keys (validator/withdraw), so from the user standpoint, in order to voluntarily exit:\r\n - I either require to obtain the validator key (and most likely give it to the staking service making both user and service at risk)\r\n - Obtain signed transactions (possibly epoch/nonce bound) to **voluntarily exit** and managing those to know when&why to use them (possibly through 3rd party service) and renew them at some point.\r\n\r\nThis proposal is about assigning the role **voluntarily exit** to the withdrawal key, this is a halfway solution to role assignment to keys but a better solution nonetheless as it gives more power to the user!\r\n\r\nSide note:\r\nIn the scenario above where you have 2 services and 1 user, the ideal solution is to have 3 keys with different role except for the key kept in cold storage (withdrawal key) that could/should have more power and a way to rotate/update key specified in the deposit contract. Since we have few roles, they could be stored in a bitfield along with the pubkeys / key commitments.",

This will mean that loss of the staking key is not an unacceptable loss anymore, and we can for example use simple hardware modules that don't allow any export (not even backup) -- this might mitigate many of the concerns of people being able to hack/acquire lots of keys.",

It's technically just shortcut to exiting and restaking, which comes with long capital lockup times, which are actually unnecessary given that the same amount of capital will be staked again (and is, of course, still subject to slashing by messages from the previous staking key(s)).",
