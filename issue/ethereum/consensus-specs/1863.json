    "body": "- 0-length vectors are illegal. (same for containers)\r\n- 0-limit lists are legal.\r\n\r\nThe reasoning for the fixed-length types here is that fixed-length types do not have an offset if a dynamic type has a collection of them. Making it impossible to say how many there are: it's a `scope / element_size = N / 0` case here.\r\n\r\nHowever, lists will ALWAYS have an offset if any type wraps them, because they couldn't be presented otherwise (Well, except a list at top-most level type, which has a natural scope by input-length, e.g. a byte list doesn't have a length-encoding envelop in SSZ).\r\n\r\nBesides, it is a previously used feature of configuring the lists of block-operations in the beacon block to have a 0 limit, to disable the use of that operation. Previously used in transfers. And currently we are considering disabling slashings in some testnets, as a fun way to stress the networks by publishing validator keys, and having everyone sign arbitrary things without retribution.\r\n",
