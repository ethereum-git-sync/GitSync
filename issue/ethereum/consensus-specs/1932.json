  "body": "The specs seem to use different types of signatures for functions. for instance:\r\n\r\nCase 1:\r\n```\r\ndef state_transition(state: BeaconState, signed_block: SignedBeaconBlock, validate_result: bool=True) -> BeaconState:\r\n block = signed_block.message\r\n    # Process slots (including those with no blocks) since block\r\n    process_slots(state, block.slot)\r\n    # Verify signature\r\n    if validate_result:\r\n        assert verify_block_signature(state, signed_block)\r\n    # Process block\r\n    process_block(state, block)\r\n    # Verify state root\r\n    if validate_result:\r\n        assert block.state_root == hash_tree_root(state)\r\n    # Return post-state\r\n    return state\r\n```\r\n\r\nand case 2:\r\n\r\n```\r\ndef process_slots(state: BeaconState, slot: Slot) -> None:\r\n    assert state.slot < slot\r\n    while state.slot < slot:\r\n        process_slot(state)\r\n        # Process epoch on the start slot of the next epoch\r\n        if (state.slot + 1) % SLOTS_PER_EPOCH == 0:\r\n            process_epoch(state)\r\n        state.slot = Slot(state.slot + 1)\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn case 1, it seems redundant to return a `BeaconState` because the `state` variable is passed by reference (I am not Python expert, but AFAIK `state` is mutable and hence passed by reference.) But the fact that the function's return type is a `BeaconState` also gives a false sense of immutability of the input object `state`. The result is actually in `state` (side-effect and in the returned value.\r\n\r\nIn case 2, the mutability of the parameter `state` is used and instead of returning a `state`, `process_slots` modifies `state`, so the result is obtained by a side-effect on input parameter `state` (passed by reference).\r\n\r\n**Main question:** How is the choice of a function signature determined in the specs? \r\nSome functions rely on side-effects, and some may not.\r\n\r\nPython parameters' passing and the interference with local storage is known to be rather cumbersome as described in the additional comment below, so a clear and principled way of specifying functions may help reducing of problems that can arise in implementations.\r\n\r\n**Additional comment**\r\nFor instance (again, I am not a Python expert, so if this is wrong, please correct me), the following code may not have any side-effect on `state` and leave the input parameter (although passed by reference) `state` unchanged:\r\n```\r\nclass BeaconState:\r\n    def __init__(self, slot):\r\n        self.slot = slot\r\n\r\ndef process_slots(state: BeaconState, slot: int) -> None:\r\n    s = BeaconState(0)\r\n    s.slot = state.slot\r\n    # the value of s is the same as the initial value of state\r\n    state = s\r\n    while state.slot < slot:\r\n        state.slot = (state.slot + 1)\r\n\r\n# k is a BeaconState\r\nk = BeaconState(2)\r\nprint (k.slot) # Result is 2\r\nprocess_slots(k, 4)\r\nprint (k.slot) # result is still 2\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe specs may benefit from a clearer definition of the functions (without side-effects).\r\n",

The result is actually in state (side-effect and in the returned value.\r\n\r\nI agree with this. In fact, on a first reading of the spec, I also interpreted `state_transition` to be a pure function based just on it's signature.\r\n\r\n> @franck44 \r\nThe specs may benefit from a clearer definition of the functions (without side-effects).\r\n\r\nAgain, I agree with this. \r\nAs a first step, I think that documenting the current behavior will largely help first-time readers to understand the spec swiftly & correctly. I also support the larger goal of making the spec more \"functional\" in it's behavior. \r\n\r\nI'll bring up this issue in the next spec team call & post updates in this thread.",
