  "body": "Some overflows may happen in several helper functions of the Beacon Chain.\r\nThis results in security vulnerabilities [CWE-190, integer overflow](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/190.html).\r\n\r\n### How the problem was discovered?\r\nAs part of the [formal verification of the Eth2.0 specification in Dafny](https://github.com/ConsenSys/eth2.0-dafny) project.\r\n\r\n### Detailed analysis, fixes and correctness proofs of the fixes.\r\nDetailed analysis and fixes reported as [issue 45](https://github.com/ConsenSys/eth2.0-dafny/issues/45\r\n) of the [eth2.0-dafny](https://github.com/ConsenSys/eth2.0-dafny) project.\r\nCorrectness formal proofs of the fixes have been established using Dafny 2.3.0. \r\n\r\n### Possible overflow in assert statement in `get_block_root_at_slot`\r\nThe following code snippet contains a `assert` statement that may result in an overflow:\r\n```python\r\ndef get_block_root_at_slot(state: BeaconState, slot: Slot) -> Root:\r\n    \"\"\"\r\n    Return the block root at a recent ``slot``.\r\n    \"\"\"\r\n    assert slot < state.slot <= slot + SLOTS_PER_HISTORICAL_ROOT  \r\n    return state.block_roots[slot % SLOTS_PER_HISTORICAL_ROOT]\r\n```\r\n**note**: the above `assert` is not a pre-condition to guarantee the absence of `array-out-of-bounds` error when dereferencing `state.block_roots`  (this never happens because `block_roots` has size `SLOTS_PER_HISTORICAL_ROOT`)  but a **functional property** of the system (requesting the block root for a slot that is too far in the past should not be permitted).\r\n\r\nThe pre-condition of the previous function should be strengthened to prevent ` slot + SLOTS_PER_HISTORICAL_ROOT` from overflowing i.e. `assert(slot as int + SLOTS_PER_HISTORICAL_ROOT as int < 0x10000000000000000)` where\r\n`0x10000000000000000` is max(unit64) + 1.\r\n\r\n```\r\n### Possible overflow in `compute_start_slot_at_epoch`\r\nBecause `Epoch` ranges over `uint64`, the multiplication can overflow in the following code snippet:\r\n```python\r\ndef compute_start_slot_at_epoch(epoch: Epoch) -> Slot:\r\n    \"\"\"\r\n    Return the start slot of ``epoch``.\r\n    \"\"\"\r\n    return Slot(epoch * SLOTS_PER_EPOCH)\r\n```\r\nThe pre-condition should be strengthened to `epoch as int * SLOTS_PER_EPOCH as int < 0x10000000000000000`\r\n\r\n### Other functions impacted by the previous strengthening of pre-conditions\r\nAs a result functions calling `compute_start_slot_at_epoch` or `get_block_root_at_slot` should have their pre-conditions strengthened.\r\nThis includes `get_block_root`\r\n```python\r\ndef get_block_root(state: BeaconState, epoch: Epoch) -> Root:\r\n    \"\"\"\r\n    Return the block root at the start of a recent ``epoch``.\r\n    \"\"\"\r\n    return get_block_root_at_slot(state, compute_start_slot_at_epoch(epoch))\r\n```\r\nthe pre-conditions of should be:\r\n```dafny\r\nfunction method get_block_root(state: BeaconState, epoch: Epoch) : Root    \r\n     requires state.slot as int + SLOTS_PER_HISTORICAL_ROOT as int < 0x10000000000000000 // Max(uint64) + 1\r\n     requires epoch as int * SLOTS_PER_EPOCH as int < 0x10000000000000000   \r\n     requires compute_start_slot_at_epoch(epoch) < state.slot <= compute_start_slot_at_epoch(epoch) + SLOTS_PER_HISTORICAL_ROOT  \r\n{ \r\n        var e := compute_start_slot_at_epoch(epoch);\r\n        get_block_root_at_slot(state, e)\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Conclusion\r\nThe proposed strengthening of pre-conditions in the previous functions guarantee the absence of overflows in all of them.",
