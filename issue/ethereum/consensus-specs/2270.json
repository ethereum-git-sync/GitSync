  "body": "The current [Union type](https://github.com/ethereum/eth2.0-specs/blob/dev/ssz/simple-serialize.md#composite-types) is not used in Phase0, and largely not yet implemented in client implementations (exception: lighthouse). In more dynamic contexts, it's could be very useful however. \r\n\r\nThe direct motivation for this is the [Merge block format](https://github.com/ethereum/eth2.0-specs/pull/2257), in which we may see different transaction types that need to be encoded. To avoid overhead of lots of unused zero fields (SSZ does not truncate zeroes like RLP does), you would need different transaction type definitions. And how do you mix these different transactions in the same list, with a Union type.\r\n\r\nOne problem is that it takes 4 bytes per `Union` selector index (the switch between the type options), and we only really see a few type options in the common use case. This is a simple proposal to parametrize (at the type level, compile-time) the selector byte length. E.g. `Union[4, [uint256, Bitvector, uint8]]` would be **backwards compatible** with the already specified `Union[uint256, Bitvector, uint8]`. This would allow us to specify something like `Union[TRANSACTION_SELECTOR_LENGTH, [LegacyTransaction, BetterTransaction, SuperTransaction, AbstractedTransaction]]` (and yes, the selected index is part of the merkleization, no confusion between types in the merkle proof)\r\n\r\nFor the merge specifically, an alternative is to use opaque transactions (`List[byte, max_size], a.k.a. Bytes[max_size]` to encode an RLP transaction, instead of structured data). The pro is that the beacon-spec does not have to care about transaction types, the con is that we miss out on SSZ merkleization of transactions into the block-root, one of the very primary places that merkle-proofs would actually be very useful (you can construct a merkle proof about any transaction detail).\r\n\r\nAs a proof of concept, I implemented this new `Union` behavior in `remerkleable`, the SSZ library used in the python specification. See [here](https://github.com/protolambda/remerkleable/pull/9). (*Note for code reader: it represents the data as binary tree, and overlays it with views, it's focused on merkle proofs and data sharing more so than structural efficiency*).\r\n\r\n",

    "body": "@djrtwo I think I prefer `Union[selector_length, [types...]]` because of the symmetry of the typing with `key, value` (`selcted_index, selected_value`) and because the `[types...]` parameter is constrained by the first parameter (can't have more than 256 types with `selector_length == 1`). And with long lists of types it doesn't end up at the very end:\r\n```\r\nclass Block(Container):\r\n  transactions: Union[TRANSACTION_SELECTOR_SIZE, [\r\n    BasicTransaction,\r\n    SpecialTransaction,\r\n    FoobarTransaction,\r\n    AnotherTransaction\r\n  ]]\r\n```\r\nFor more similarity with `List` and `Vector` we could instead define it as `N` reserved options, and derive the selector byte length to cover the reserved count.\r\nAnother change we could make is to parametrize it with a map, like: `Union[selector_size, {0: BasicTransaction, 0x42: SpecialTransaction}]` if we want to use specific selector bytes.\r\n\r\n\r\n@axic Good point, indicating something is reserved for extension purposes can be part of the `Union` spec. It's not a bitfield though, so reserving just the `0xff` selector, or some small range, could be sufficient.\r\n\r\n",

    "body": "I'm fine with dropping the selector to one byte. I would prefer one-byte instead of a variable-length selector. Although variable-length is more powerful, I think single-byte adheres better to the first S (simple) of SSZ. A union with more than 256 variants would be pretty gross and I don't think we should add complexity to the simple case (a few variants) to cover this.\r\n\r\nOn the lighthouse end, we only use Union for the `Option` Rust type (which is either `None` or `Some(value)`). If we wanted to avoid a DB migration (at the expense of some technical debt) we could introduce a `LegacySszOption` type which serializes in the old way. That's fairly painless for us.\r\n\r\nLooping in @michaelsproul as well :)",
