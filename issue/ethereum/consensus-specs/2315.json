  "body": "- [ ] 1. **Server discovery**: How can light clients find servers efficiently?\r\n- [ ] 2. **Find `LightClientSnapshot` initially**: as @djrtwo mentioned, Req/Resp may not be good snapshot resource.\r\n    - **[Proposal]** Can we say, we expect 3rd party to provide LightClientSnapshot + Merkle proofs or multi-proof of each field, where the proof can be verified against WS source?\r\n- [ ] 3. **Block tree verification in current time-out procedure and reorg**: In the current spec, a timeout-triggered (8192 slots, ~27 hours ) update logic exists:\r\n    - Step 1, `on_light_client_update`, light client appends the valid update\r\n    - Step 2, when timeout, call `apply_light_client_update` to update the store snapshot with *the most voted* update from `store.valid_updates`.\r\n    - **[Proposal]**: In step 1, for the non-finality update (`update.finality_header == BeaconBlockHeader()`), should we add assert of checking if the `update.header` is descendant of `snapshot.header`. (<-- as @vbuterin suggested, make the light client updates always rooted in a finalized block.)\r\n        - This procedure assumes that the light client already has `store.valid_updates` before timeout. That is, at the timeout slot, either (i) the server has to send a chain of updates to the light clients, or (ii) the light client has to request for the updates.\r\n    - Or apply other reorgable light client solutions? (https://github.com/ethereum/eth2.0-specs/issues/2182)\r\n- [x] 4. Use **gossip as default sync resource** and then servers just as backup?\r\n     - Note: the size of `LightClientUpdate` object:\r\n         - header: `200`\r\n         - next_sync_committee: about `48*1024 + 48*16 = 49920`\r\n         - next_sync_committee_branch: about `32*5 = 160`\r\n         - finality_header: `200`\r\n         - finality_branch: about `32*6 = 192`\r\n         - sync_aggregate: about `1024 + 96 = 1120`\r\n         - fork_version: `4`\r\n         - **Total: ~51,796 bytes**\r\n     - *Edited:* @vbuterin suggested [making light client only download 256 members from sync committee instead of 1024](https://github.com/ethereum/eth2.0-specs/pull/2130#issuecomment-727561160)\r\n     - **Updated**: `SYNC_COMMITTEE_SIZE` has been updated to 512 via #2371\r\n- [ ] 5. More comprehensive/production **client-server model**\r\n    - @protolambda: If this is a push-update, and there is no explicit subscription kind of approach for a light client, then we should spec out when and how often the server pushes the update.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Other questions:\r\n\r\n- [x] `EPOCHS_PER_SYNC_COMMITTEE_PERIOD` is `2**8` epochs = `2**13` slots ~= 27 hours. `LIGHT_CLIENT_UPDATE_TIMEOUT` is also `2**13` slots ~= 27 hours.\r\n    1. Should we just keep one constant?\r\n    2. If not, is `EPOCHS_PER_SYNC_COMMITTEE_PERIOD >= LIGHT_CLIENT_UPDATE_TIMEOUT` an invariant?\r\n    - **Updated**: `LIGHT_CLIENT_UPDATE_TIMEOUT` has been removed via #2378 \r\n",
