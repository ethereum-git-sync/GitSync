  "body": "We need to schedule a follow-up meeting to expand on [last week's discussion](https://github.com/ethereum/pm/blob/master/All%20Core%20Devs%20Meetings/Eth1x%20Sync%201.md) regarding the simulation working group and setting up a testnet for 1.x/2.0 development. \r\n\r\nFor the sake of time, we can quickly provision a testnet using the current [Whiteblock](www.whiteblock.io) framework. This can be a permissioned testnet which anyone can join. The network parameters and additional environmental configurations can be changed based on the needs of the participants. In order to get this testnet up and running, we first need to identify the network specifications and initial testing plan. An example test plan can be referenced [here](https://notes.ethereum.org/Q_kQKXZUQD29YCshej1qPQ). This testnet can be used for both 1.x and 2.0 purposes or separate networks can be provisioned. \r\n\r\nFurther details for the setup and required specifications would be best covered during the call. I would like to schedule this call before Friday's meeting so we're not taking occupying too much time on the subject. Please respond if you would like to join this call and feel free to share your immediate thoughts on the matter, if appropriate. \r\n\r\nI am proposing to schedule this call for Thursday (December 6) at 3:30PM (UTC), which is 7:30AM PST. \r\n\r\nThanks!",

We can quickly configure and deploy an entire testnet, including the process of configuring nodes, generating accounts, funding these accounts, automating  transactions, and all the other stuff that's required to replicate real-world performance in a controlled testing environment. The \"dummy\" nodes are provisioned to ensure a minimum baseline of activity in a network to reduce dependency on third-party cooperation, among other things. We covered a lot of this on last week's call, but we'll go over it in more detail on Thursday. \r\n\r\nUsers who wish to participate and test within this network can provision their own node and join the network if they so choose and since it's all managed, it can be controlled in a manner that ensures deterministic results. Since it's permissioned and controlled, we don't need to worry about alternative consensus mechanisms and since the network itself is ephemeral, we can tear one down and start a new one that's equally populated within a few minutes. Like I said, we'll go over all this on the call. \r\n",
