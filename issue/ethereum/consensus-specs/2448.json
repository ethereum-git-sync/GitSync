  "body": "In the current Altair Specs, only `SYNC_COMMITTEE_SIZE (512)` validators out of the current 150K on mainnet will earn rewards for over 2 days. Validators that aren't chosen to participate on the sync committee will forfeit 1/8 of their earnings until they are finally chosen. The probabilities of not being in a single sync committee for a single validator are \r\n\r\n```\r\n1 month             |          95.65% \r\n6 months            |          76.33%\r\n1 year              |          57.86%\r\n2 years             |          33.37%\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhich means that after two years of staking, we will still see at least 50K validators without earning 1/8 of their rewards. \r\n\r\nA proposal to remedy this is to simply get rid of the committee sync rewards, and apply a penalty to those validators that fail to participate in the committee. The total rewards can be guaranteed to be still one `base_rewards` by adjusting the weights as \r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nTIMELY_SOURCE_WEIGHT\tuint64(14)\r\nTIMELY_TARGET_WEIGHT\tuint64(28)\r\nTIMELY_HEAD_WEIGHT\tuint64(14)\r\nPROPOSER_WEIGHT\t        uint64(8)\r\nWEIGHT_DENOMINATOR\tuint64(64)\r\n```\r\nAnd adding a penalty weight \r\n\r\n```\r\nSYNC_PENALTY_WEIGHT\tuint64(8)\r\n```\r\n\r\n The changes to the current specs seem to be minimal, a WIP can be found in \r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/ethereum/eth2.0-specs/compare/dev...potuz:penalize-sync-comiittee?expand=1\r\n\r\nSome dissadvantages of the minimal proposal above are\r\n\r\n- Validators on the first sync committe may be penalized unfairly for the first few slots\r\n- Validators that are offline and are assigned to a sync committee will be severely penalized\r\n\r\nThe first point can be fixed in-protocol by not penalizing on the first few epochs. The second one, under current conditions of participation rate above 99%, the probability than an offline validator is chosen for a sync committee is `3 * 10^-5` so it is negligible. \r\n\r\nAdvantages are \r\n\r\n- Single stakers will be able to maintain their full rewards without the need of luck. Without this it would be beneficial for them to move to staking pools\r\n- The penalty can be simply reduced by adjusting two parameters without modifing the invariant of one `base_reward`  earnings per epoch.
