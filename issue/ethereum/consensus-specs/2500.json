  "body": "## What the problem is and where it is located\r\n\r\nThe following relates to [eth2.0-specs/specs/phase0/beacon-chain.md](https://github.com/ethereum/eth2.0-specs/blob/dev/specs/phase0/beacon-chain.md).\r\n\r\nIt appears that the `committee` created in `get_attesting_indices` can exceed length of `MAX_VALIDATORS_PER_COMMITTEE` and hence this will cause an array-out-of-bound runtime error when accessing `bits` to return the set of attesting indices. The problem occurs when the number of active validators exceeds `2**22 = 4,194,304`.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1168\" alt=\"code1\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43776922/123884772-5c7a4600-d98f-11eb-8d38-4f89443174d9.png\">\r\n\r\nI would note that strictly speaking, the SSZ definition of a `bitlist` means that `|bits| <= MAX_VALIDATORS_PER_COMMITTEE` and so a more accurate requirement for `get_attesting_indices` is that:\r\n\r\n`|committee| <= |bits| <= MAX_VALIDATORS_PER_COMMITTEE` (i.e.2048)\r\n\r\nhowever, the purpose of this analysis is to understand when \r\n`|committee| > MAX_VALIDATORS_PER_COMMITTEE`.\r\n\r\n## How was the problem discovered\r\n\r\nThe problem was discovered while using Dafny to formally verify the Beacon Chain Phase 0 spec ([eth2.0-dafny](https://github.com/ConsenSys/eth2.0-dafny)).\r\n\r\nAs I think the issue can be difficult to detect, particularly with the use of floor division and the dependency of parameter calculations between functions, I thought it would be useful to step through the calculations involved, which I do below. \r\n\r\n## Results of the analysis\r\n\r\nThe key results are that:\r\n\r\n- when 32 <= **number of active validators** <= 4,194,304, the length of `committee` will range between 1 and `MAX_VALIDATORS_PER_COMMITTEE` (inclusive) for all `data.slot` and `data.index` combinations\r\n- when 4,194,304 < **number of active validators** < 4,196,352, `committee` will have length greater than `MAX_VALIDATORS_PER_COMMITTEE` for at least one `data.slot` and `data.index` combination\r\n- when 4,196,352 <= **number of active validators**, `committee` will have length greater than `MAX_VALIDATORS_PER_COMMITTEE` for all `data.slot` and `data.index` combinations\r\n\r\nAnd for completeness, please note that:\r\n\r\n- when **number of active validators** < 32, `committee` will have length 0 for some `data.slot` and `data.index` combinations\r\n\r\n## Possible solution\r\n\r\nIf in `get_attesting_indices`we assume that `|bits| = MAX_VALIDATORS_PER_COMMITTEE` then a basic solution is to modify  `compute_committee` such that:\r\n\r\n`end = min(start + MAX_VALIDATORS_PER_COMMITTEE, (len(indices) * (index+1)) // count)`.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Detailed analysis\r\n\r\n#### Context\r\n`get_attesting_indices` is used as part of the rewards and penalties, justification and finalisation, as well as process_attestion.\r\n\r\nFor context I thought it was useful to show the function call paths.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1254\" alt=\"functions\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43776922/123884812-7451ca00-d98f-11eb-8228-9e4e1626bf28.png\">\r\n\r\n#### Tracing the problem\r\n\r\nTo determine how the length of `committee` is calculated we must look at `get_beacon_committee`.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1151\" alt=\"code2\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43776922/123884896-a8c58600-d98f-11eb-8cfc-c81399334654.png\">\r\n\r\nThe output of `get_beacon_committee` is then determined by the call to `compute_committee`.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1158\" alt=\"code3\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43776922/123884916-b2e78480-d98f-11eb-86b1-7a76dfebc7df.png\">\r\n\r\nIf we start with the return statement in `compute_committee`, the returned sequence will have a length determined by `range(start, end)`. Specifically, `range(start, end)` will yield a sequence of length `end-start` and hence:\r\n\r\n```\r\n|compute_committee(indices, seed, index, count)| \r\n= end-start\r\n= (len(indices) * (index+1)) // count - (len(indices) * index) // count\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen `compute_committee` is called from `get_beacon_committee` we see that:\r\n\r\n- `indices = get_active_validator_indices` \r\n- `seed = get_seed` \r\n- `index = (slot % SLOTS_PER_EPOCH) * committees_per_slot + index`\r\n- `count = committees_per_slot * SLOTS_PER_EPOCH`\r\n\r\n(Note that the `index` parameter in `get_beacon_committee` is different to the `index` parameter in `compute_committee`).\r\n\r\nMaking these substitutions, at the `get_beacon_committee` level we determine `end` and `start` as follows:\r\n\r\n- `end = (len(get_active_validator_indices) * (((slot % SLOTS_PER_EPOCH) * committees_per_slot + index)+1)) // (committees_per_slot * SLOTS_PER_EPOCH) `\r\n- `start = (len(get_active_validator_indices) * ((slot % SLOTS_PER_EPOCH) * committees_per_slot + index)) // (committees_per_slot * SLOTS_PER_EPOCH) `\r\n\r\nThis is also a good time to mention that `committees_per_slot` is determined by a call to `get_committees_per_slot` and is calculated as follows:\r\n\r\n`committees_per_slot = max(1, min(MAX_COMMITTEES_PER_SLOT, len(get_active_validator_indices) // SLOTS_PER_EPOCH // TARGET_COMMITTEE_SIZE))`\r\n\r\n`committees_per_slot` is therefore a function of the number of active validators  and 0 < `committees_per_slot` <= 64.\r\n\r\nWe could now substitute the formula for `committees_per_slot` into `end` and `start` but for the purpose of this analysis we can conclude that `end - start` is a function of:\r\n\r\n- `len(get_active_validator_indices)`,\r\n- `slot % SLOTS_PER_EPOCH`, and\r\n- `index` (i.e. the committee `index` parameter of `get_beacon_committee`).\r\n\r\nIt is also useful to note the following bounds on these values:\r\n\r\n- 0 <= `slot % SLOTS_PER_EPOCH` < 32\r\n- 0 <= `index` < `committees_per_slot`\r\n\r\nPutting all of this together, when `get_beacon_committee(state, data.slot, data.index)` is called from `get_attesting_indices` for a state of a particular number of active validators, it can be done so for multiple (`data.slot`,`data.index`) combinations according to the above (`slot % SLOTS_PER_EPOCH`,`index`) bounds. \r\n\r\nFurther in relation to the `index` bounds, as `committees_per_slot` depends on the number of activate validators, the range of `index` also depends on the number of active validators. Once the number of active validators is sufficiently large, there will be a maximum of `32 * 64 = 2048` of these (`slot % SLOTS_PER_EPOCH`,`index`) combinations to consider for a state with a particular number of active validators.\r\n\r\nTo determine for which (`len(get_active_validator_indices)`, `slot % SLOTS_PER_EPOCH`,`index`) combinations we find that `end - start > MAX_VALIDATORS_PER_COMMITTEE` we need to analyse the above formulas for `end` and `start`. Of course, the use of floor division (i.e. `//`) makes this more difficult than regular division and hence here I will just show the overall results but I will include several specific examples where a bound breach occurs (i.e. where `end - start > MAX_VALIDATORS_PER_COMMITTEE`).\r\n\r\nI thought some visualisations might assist.\r\n\r\nLet's firstly consider how many `committees_per_slot` there will be for 0 < `len(get_active_validator_indices)` < 4,250,000.\r\n\r\n![analysis1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43776922/123885054-f7732000-d98f-11eb-9e69-e793e0828650.png)\r\n\r\nWe see that once there are `2**18=262,144` or more active validators, `committees_per_slot` will reach its upper bound of 64.\r\n\r\nThe value of `committees_per_slot` consequently determines the number of (`slot % SLOTS_PER_EPOCH`,`index`) combinations to consider for a state with a particular number of active validators. \r\n\r\nIn the next graph we plot the number of (`slot % SLOTS_PER_EPOCH`,`index`) combinations, as well as how many of these input combinations will produce `end - start > MAX_VALIDATORS_PER_COMMITTEE` and hence ultimately how many `|committee| > MAX_VALIDATORS_PER_COMMITTEE` breaches occur at a given number of active validators.\r\n\r\n![analysis2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43776922/123885075-ffcb5b00-d98f-11eb-94aa-7aa345285982.png)\r\n\r\nWe observe that the number of (`slot % SLOTS_PER_EPOCH`,`index`) combinations reaches its maximum of `32 * 64 = 2048` at `2**18=262144` active validators (i.e. as is expected given the Figure 1 in which `committees_per_slot` reaches its maximum at that number of active validators).\r\n\r\nWe can also observe that the number of these combinations where `|committee| = end - start > MAX_VALIDATORS_PER_COMMITTEE` is zero until the number of active validators exceeds `2**22 = 4,194,304`.\r\n\r\nIf we focus on this particular area of the graph, we see:\r\n\r\n![analysis3](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43776922/123885100-0b1e8680-d990-11eb-8aa4-587543ff85fa.png)\r\n\r\nHence, once the number of active validators exceeds `2**22 = 4,194,304` we can observe that there are (`slot % SLOTS_PER_EPOCH`,`index`) combinations such that `|committee| > MAX_VALIDATORS_PER_COMMITTEE`. Further, once the number of active validators reaches `2**22 + 2**11 = 4,196,352` we can observe that all (`slot % SLOTS_PER_EPOCH`,`index`) combinations will result in `|committee| > MAX_VALIDATORS_PER_COMMITTEE`.\r\n\r\n#### Examples\r\n\r\nWe can now look at a couple of examples to see which (`slot % SLOTS_PER_EPOCH`,`index`) combinations cause the problem for a set number of active validators.\r\n\r\nFor example, when the number of active validators is `4,194,305` we can see that (`slot % SLOTS_PER_EPOCH=31`,`index=63`) will be the only committee such that `|committee| > MAX_VALIDATORS_PER_COMMITTEE`. i.e. as indicated by the red block.\r\n\r\n![eg1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43776922/123885117-140f5800-d990-11eb-9949-ddd8628e55ea.png)\r\n\r\nWhere as when the number of active validators is for example `4,194,355`, we can see that numerous (`slot % SLOTS_PER_EPOCH`,`index`) combinations result in `|committee| > MAX_VALIDATORS_PER_COMMITTEE`. i.e. as indicated by the red blocks.\r\n\r\n![eg2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43776922/123885130-1d002980-d990-11eb-8ccf-7c3a52fbd543.png)\r\n\r\nI was able to prove the generalised results using formal verification in Dafny ([eth2.0-dafny](https://github.com/ConsenSys/eth2.0-dafny)) but to create the visualisations shown here I simply created a Jupyter notebook so as to explore the equations numerically.\r\n",
