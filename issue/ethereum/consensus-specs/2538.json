  "body": "I'd like to confirm what's the expected behavior of `eth2_aggregate_pubkeys([G1_POINT_AT_INFINITY])` call.\r\n\r\n### `eth2_aggregate_pubkeys([G1_POINT_AT_INFINITY])` result?\r\n\r\nSince (i) `AggregatePKs` is not defined in the IETF standard and (ii) `AggregatePKs` functionality is using in Altair, we defined an [`eth2_aggregate_pubkeys`](https://github.com/ethereum/eth2.0-specs/blob/dev/specs/altair/bls.md#eth2_aggregate_pubkeys) function to aggregate the pubkeys. That is, aggregate pubkeys logic will be in the consensus layer since Altair HF.\r\n\r\nSince it's not part of IETF standard, the BLS libs may have implemented the \"basic\" `AggregatePKs` API differently:\r\n- Let `G1_POINT_AT_INFINITY = b'\\xc0' + b'\\x00' * 47`\r\n- py_ecc: `py_ecc._AggregatePKs([G1_POINT_AT_INFINITY])` is VALID\r\n- milagro: `milagro_bls._AggregatePKs([G1_POINT_AT_INFINITY])` is INVALID\r\n    - It seems that `PublicKeys` cannot be the point at infinity in Milagro: https://github.com/sigp/milagro_bls/issues/40#issuecomment-712645746.\r\n    - IIUC, Milagro allows aggregating G2 point at infinity (signatures). I think it's because Milagro assumes that pubkeys *should have passed `KeyValidate` so inf point is not in the allowed domain*. It's similar to how we handled pubkeys in IETF `FastAggregateVerify`.\r\n\r\n### Discussions\r\n1. Should we have `eth2_aggregate_pubkeys([G1_POINT_AT_INFINITY])` test vectors?\r\n    - Note that `eth2_aggregate_pubkeys([G1_POINT_AT_INFINITY])` should never be triggered in Altair since all the possible pubkeys should have passed `KeyValidate`.\r\n    - However, I'm not sure about the future usage of `eth2_aggregate_pubkeys` and other Ethereum-specific BLS functions. e.g., we may want to use G1 point at infinity to represent the *\"emptiness\"* in other cases; similar to how we use `G2_POINT_AT_INFINITY` in `eth2_fast_aggregate_verify`.\r\n2. If so, should we make `eth2_aggregate_pubkeys([G1_POINT_AT_INFINITY])` invalid in the test vectors?\r\n    - If yes, I'd say we should describe this behavior in the `eth2_fast_aggregate_verify` description or pseudo code.\r\n\r\n\r\n/cc @kirk-baird @mratsim @benjaminion @nisdas @wemeetagain @ChihChengLiang  🙏",
