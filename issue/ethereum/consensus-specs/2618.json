  "body": "In the [p2p-interface](https://github.com/ethereum/consensus-specs/blob/4c1156d504279069799924dbbc79cf13d9454ae3/specs/merge/p2p-interface.md) specifications for The Merge, the following rule applies during `beacon_block` gossip verification:\r\n\r\n> - If the merge is complete with respect to the head state -- i.e. is_merge_complete(state) -- then validate the following:\r\n>     - [REJECT] The block's execution payload must be non-empty -- i.e. execution_payload != ExecutionPayload()\r\n\r\nI'm curious about why a post-merge **head state** can prohibit the import of pre-merge blocks.\r\n\r\nConsider the following scenario:\r\n\r\n- A beacon proposer (`BP1`) is on a minority fork of the execution chain. That minority fork has crossed the `total_terminal_difficulty` (TTD) threshold.\r\n- `BP1` produces a block, validates it and sets it as its own head.\r\n- The beacon proposer for the next slot (`BP2`) was not on the minority execution fork and therefore rejected the block from `BP1`\r\n- `BP2` produces a block that conflicts with the one from `BP1` *and* does not trigger the merge.\r\n- The execution node of `BP1` converges with the network and reverts to the same chain as `BP2`\r\n- `BP1` will reject the block from `BP2`, even though it is valid and may be destined to become the majority chain.\r\n\r\nI think that in practice `BP1` would end up importing the block from `BP2` via RPC, but it seems a little odd to rely on that procedure.\r\n\r\nUltimately, my question is:\r\n\r\nDo we desire this \"latching\" which prevents us from importing and propagating a non-merge gossip block after we've elected a merge block as the head?",
