  "body": "It seems like there was a difference in client implementation's selection of the `Fork` to use when validating gossip.  This only affects periods leading up to a network upgrade so isn't a major issue but could lead to downscoring peers or operations not being gossiped well.\r\n\r\nI believe now all clients use the `Fork` from their current chain head when validating voluntary exits and slashings. However given that each gossip topic is for a specific fork, including the fork ID in the gossip name, it seems more accurate to validate using the `Fork` used for that specific topic.\r\n\r\nLogging an issue on this mostly as a place holder that this needs to be thought through better. In particular we wouldn't want to have slashings be lost because of gossip validation rules and thus have violations go unpunished.",
