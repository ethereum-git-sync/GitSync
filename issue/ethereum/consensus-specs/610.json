  "body": "I found it quite difficult to discern what the `winning_root` function is.\r\n\r\nMy initial confusion arose from the following:\r\n\r\n- It seems that `winning_root` takes `crosslink_committee` because it passes it to `attesting_validator_indices(...)`, however that function does not use it. \r\n- `winning_root(...)` takes `crosslink_committee` as an argument. When `winning_root` is called, it is passed `List[ValidatorIndex]` as the `crosslink_committee`. It was unclear to me where `shard` comes from.\r\n\r\nI came to the conclusion that `crosslink_committee` should really be `Tuple[List[ValidatorIndex], ShardNumber]` and that `shard` in `attesting_validator_indices(..)` is actually `crosslink_committee.shard` (See #609).\r\n\r\nThen, I just made a leap and figured that you're probably looking to pick the shard roots that have the most ETH voted for them.\r\n\r\nAs such, if you wanted to get the `winning_root` for some `shard`, you:\r\n\r\n- Let `attestations` be `current_epoch_attestations + previous_epoch_attestations`.\r\n- Let `shard_balances` be a map of `shard_block_root -> attesting_balance`.\r\n- For each `attestation` in `attestations` if `attestation.shard == shard`:\r\n   - Let `attesting_indices` be `get_attestation_participants(state, a.data, a.aggregation_bitfield)`.\r\n   - Let `attesting_balance` be `get_total_balance(state, attesting_indices)`\r\n   - Do `shard_balances[shard_block_root] += attesting_balance`.\r\n- Let `winning_root` be the `shard_block_root` with the highest `attesting_balance` (ties are broken by favoring lower `shard_block_root` values).\r\n\r\n## Summary\r\n\r\n- I found the definition of `winning_root` to be confusing.\r\n- Can you please confirm my understanding of the intention of the function is correct?",

    "body": "> I found the definition of `winning_root` to be confusing.\r\n\r\nAgreed. It's still hard to digest and may be too abstract.\r\n\r\n> Can you please confirm my understanding of the intention of the function is correct?\r\n\r\nHere is our implementation. It turns out to be less functional programming than the spec:\r\n1. https://github.com/ethereum/trinity/blob/2058916a589aa7854778d7dca331bfa292c2581a/eth2/beacon/state_machines/forks/serenity/epoch_processing.py#L93\r\n2. https://github.com/ethereum/trinity/blob/2058916a589aa7854778d7dca331bfa292c2581a/eth2/beacon/epoch_processing_helpers.py#L124-L163\r\n\r\n1. Just to make it clear, in your approach:\r\n    > * Do `shard_balances[shard_block_root] += attesting_balance`.\r\n\r\n    It's \"Do `shard_balances[a.data.shard_block_root] += attesting_balance`.\", right?\r\n2. I think although there are some differences between our implementation and your approach, the result should be the same:\r\n    1. We iterate `set([a.data.shard_block_root for a in attestations if a.data.shard == shard])`, not `shard`, because:\r\n        - the spec uses notation `attesting_validator_indices(crosslink_committee, shard_block_root) ...`.\r\n        - then we don't have the temporary map `shard_balances[shard_block_root] -> attesting_balance` in our implementation, instead, we use `(winning_root, winning_root_balance)` that stores the temporary winner during the iterations.\r\n    2. We defined `get_total_attesting_balance` as a function that takes `state`, `shard`, and `attestations` of the given `shard` as the parameters.\r\n    3. Note that it's possible that there's no winning root: https://github.com/ethereum/eth2.0-specs/issues/541\r\n\r\n/cc @NIC619, please correct me if I'm wrong.\r\n\r\n",
