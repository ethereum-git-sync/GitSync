  "body": "The `BeaconBlock.ancestor_hashes` field has the following comment:\r\n\r\n> i'th item is the most recent ancestor that is a multiple of 2**i for i = 0, ..., 31\r\n\r\nConsider a block, `A`, that is at slot `2**31 + 1` for which we're are trying to compute `ancestor_hashes`. It's immediate ancestor, block `B`, is at slot `2**31`, so therefore it should occupy `ancestor_hashes[31]` because `2**31 % 2**31 = 0`. Block `B` should also occupy `ancestor_hashes[30]` because `2**31 % 2**30 = 0`. This continues all the way down until  `2**31 % 2**0 = 0`. Ultimately, `ancestor_hashes` will be completely filled with the hash of `B`.\r\n\r\nI suspect this should not be the case?\r\n\r\nI went back in git history and saw it has been changed by the venerable @rawfalafel in #81. Maybe he could shed some light?",

    "body": "The functionality is correct, but the comment might be misleading.\r\n\r\nThink about what happens at the next block -- the 0th position changes.\r\nwhat happens two blocks from now -- the 0th and 1st position update.\r\nfour blocks -- the 0, 1, and 2nd position update.\r\n\r\nand so fourth.\r\n\r\nThe ancestor hash at 30th position stays stable until 2**30 blocks from now. Thus it serves as a point in history that you can easily walk back to. You can easily jump back 2**30 blocks and then block back two blocks. This mapping bounds the number of steps you need to take to walk back in the chain by log(n)\r\n\r\nOpen to a more descriptive comment/explanation.",
