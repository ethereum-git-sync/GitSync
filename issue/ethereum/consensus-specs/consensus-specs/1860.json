  "body": "Currently the slashing penalty does not depend on how many concurrent offending messages were signed by the malicious validator.\r\n\r\nAs an example, if a malicious proposer signs 1000 alternative proposals, effectively mounting a massive DOS attack  on the network she will still incur the minimum penalty  of 1 ETH, assuming no other validators misbehave.\r\n\r\nNote that once the validator is slashed, she becomes unslashable and, therefore, immune to further whisteblower messages.  \r\n\r\nWhat I propose, is that if multiple offending messages for the same protocol phase are submitted by whistleblowers,  the validator is punished for each new message submitted.  As an example if the validator created 1000 offending blocks, the first 32 whistleblower submissions will be paid and the validator will essentially be fully slashed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
