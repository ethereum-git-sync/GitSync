The slot range check can be used to prevent such attack\r\n\r\n**More info on the attack:**\r\nIn Prysm's DB scheme, we only hold up to certain hot (post finalization) states in memory.  When there's long period without finality, a node could get attacked by receiving attestation that's outside of slot range. Given it's outside of the slot range (eg. >2epochs behind), that's very likely the receiving node will have to do extra computations to compute for the beacon state to satisfy the committee validation and that is `committees_per_slot = get_committee_count_per_slot(state, attestation.data.target.epoch)` We have observed this pattern in the Onyx testnet when 200 epochs since finality\r\n\r\nReference fix in Prysm: https://github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm/pull/6755",

    "body": "> Is the subnet check (potentially) expensive because of the need to check for active validators at the epoch? Otherwise it seems like O(1)\r\n\r\nThe cost is getting the state. Say current epoch is 200 and last finalized epoch is 100. Clients might have frequent states cached in the 197-200 region and less frequent states cached in the 100-197 region. Bad peers could send attestations with slot outside of the invalid slot range and cause receiving peer to oversubscribe the CPU by computing states with no useful purpose",
