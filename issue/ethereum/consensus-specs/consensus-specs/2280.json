These are left for future work and discussion.\r\n\r\n*Note*: This is not an exhaustive merge todo list but is instead only open points from #2257\r\n\r\n- [x] [Debates](https://github.com/ethereum/eth2.0-specs/pull/2257#discussion_r599021130) around `application_state_transition` (should the spec know about the `ApplicationState` or just about its root hash) \r\n- [ ] [Consider eliminating](https://github.com/ethereum/eth2.0-specs/pull/2257/files#r598997175) `uint256` requirement on beacon-chain side in `PoWBlock` and TD comparison \r\n- [ ] Consider max block size in relation to `ApplicationPayload` and where should such validation happen. At gossip, inside beacon chain, or just in application gas limit. Max TX size times max txs is 16GB!\r\n- [X] [Consider `Union` type](https://github.com/ethereum/eth2.0-specs/pull/2257#issuecomment-807505782) for transaction list with a single `OPAQUE_SELECTOR` for first merge fork. More specific, structured selectors for each TX type to follow\r\n- [x] [Post-London](https://github.com/ethereum/eth2.0-specs/pull/2257#discussion_r599048199) add `base_fee` to `ApplicationPayload` \r\n- [x] Add `Hash32` type to provide more specificity than `Bytes32` and to further disambiguate from `Root`\r\n- [ ] Modularize components of fork choice in phase 0 to better facilitate code reuse https://github.com/ethereum/eth2.0-specs/pull/2257#discussion_r599015500\r\n- [ ] [Potentially rename]( https://github.com/ethereum/eth2.0-specs/pull/2257#discussion_r599049800) `Eth1Data` -- `DepostContractData`\r\n- [x] [Consider adding fields to block](https://github.com/ethereum/eth2.0-specs/issues/2280#issuecomment-808493936) to ensure there is a clean one-way map from `ApplicationPayload` to RLP block",
