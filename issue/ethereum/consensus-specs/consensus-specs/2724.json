  "body": "Original discussion happened in Discord: https://discord.com/channels/595666850260713488/692062809701482577/910086648346329099\r\nRelated to https://github.com/ethereum/consensus-specs/issues/2643\r\n\r\nThe essence of the discussion -- TTD should be known in advance and should be the only trigger of consensus upgrade on EL side, details and implications:\r\n* EL client must know TTD in advance to have a clear boundary at which the consensus upgrade happens. Handling the case when sister blocks have different consensus rules adds a lot of complexity to the fork machinery of EL clients.\r\n* TTD must be the only trigger of the consensus upgrade because adding another brings the same complexity issue as the previous case. It means that `TERMINAL_BLOCK_HASH` can't be used as a trigger for consensus upgrade on EL side. It means that TBH functionality may only be implemented by block whitelisting via its hash value + TTD override. EL clients currently support the whitelisting feature.\r\n\r\n### Option 1\r\nRemove TTD and TBH overrides and rely on \"release/update\" procedure in case if there is a hashpower migration that significantly delays the Merge (the TTD override case) and in case of 51% attacks (the TBH case). Cons: delays the emergency reaction by X hours -- hours required for the network to upgrade their clients.\r\n\r\n### Option 2\r\nHave override settings in CL and EL clients. Cons: bricks the client in case when user restarts only CL or EL client with a new setting, i.e. overrides go inconsistent. Potentially, EL may respond with specific errors to `executePayload` and `forkchoiceUpdated` if they reference a block that isn't a valid terminal block. It would aid figuring out the issue and restarting a node with correct settings.\r\n\r\n### Option 3\r\nHave EL responsible for handling terminal block functionality and have override settings on EL only. TBH functionality can't be handled entirely by EL as TBH also comes with an epoch number which coordinates the transition on CL side. So, this option seems not viable as it lefts an issue with consistency of overrides between the layers.",

Go is super fast at building and even for us it takes 1-2h until all the binaries are published everywhere.\r\n\r\nBut I don't understand why you're so against that CLI flag.
