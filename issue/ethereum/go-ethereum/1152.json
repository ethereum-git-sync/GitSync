Yes, the addition of a `resend` function allows the user to re-submit a specific transaction, but should the transactions fall out of the memory pool if they aren't included in a certain amount of time? What other mechanisms could we use to remove these \"bad\" transactions?\n",

    "body": "This is one of these problems where it's hard to build a good user experience around the design of ethereum. The protocol requires that transactions are executed in nonce order, so we can't skip or drop them. Miners will include transactions above a certain price, but users don't know the 'market price'.\n\nThe resending is an attempt to make this easier to use. We intend to have automatic resend in the future. This could be similar to an ebay bot: users configure the maximum amount of fees they are willing to spend and the bot tries to resubmit the transaction until it is included, raising an alert only if it cannot get it included below the configured fee. \n",

    "body": "I think it's sensible to assume that in Ethereum's early days, the main incentive for miners will be the block reward, not tx fees.\n\nWe can thus consider making a sensible default which is likely to be used by most miners (but not part of the protocol, so miners CAN implement another policy if they want to).\n\nFor example, we can take a bit of inspiration from Bitcoin: https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Transaction_fees#Sending\n\nAnd have a certain amount of txs (gas to be precise) reserved for high priority txs, which can be weighted on the age of Ether moved and amount of Ether.\n\nA common argument against free txs is that no rational miners will run such a policy if it's not required by the protocol, but I think that Bitcoin proves that this is not the case, where major miners do include txs without any fee even though they don't have to.\n\nOf course the Ethereum gas economics is very different from Bitcoin, so take this as just bouncing some ideas.\n\nAside from fees, how about a default policy of simply dropping a tx after a certain age? Ethereum is designed to be fast with short block time, so most DAPPs will be designed around that. It can probably be OK to drop a tx after a relatively low number of blocks if it has not been mined yet.\n",
