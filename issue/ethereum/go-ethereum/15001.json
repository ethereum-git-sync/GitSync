  "body": "#### System information\r\n\r\nGeth version: `geth version` 1.5.9-stable, Go1.7.4\r\nOS & Version: OSX 10.12.6 MacMini 4GB RAM (latest MacMini doesn't support field RAM upgrade anymore) VDSL connection with an average of 20-40Mbit throughput. Ethereum Wallet 0.9.0\r\nCommit hash : (if `develop`)\r\n\r\n#### Expected behaviour\r\n\r\nfast sync to current latest block followed by auto disabling \r\n\r\n#### Actual behaviour\r\n\r\nstalling from a few thousand blocks up to a few hundred to current latest block. Tries to catch up to latest block, but number of new blocks is greater than the speed of adding fast blocks. Never auto disables fast sync mode.\r\n\r\n#### Steps to reproduce the behaviour\r\n\r\nRemovedb and geth --fast --cache=1024. 5 times on that machine over the last weeks. \r\n\r\nFast sync is already my workaround, starting a fresh fast sync from scratch. Before I was unsuccessful on that machine trying to sync with existing blockchain data instead. This was also a lost race of catching up to the latest block on that machine. This workaround was good until now. \r\n\r\nToday even the workaround in fast sync mode (cache -1024) will not completely load the blockchain anymore. It catches up some hundred blocks to the latest block and stalls for hours. By the time it catches up a few hundred blocks, the latest block moved ahead again. The closer geth is getting to import to the latest block (at time of writing 4173161), the slower it gets. It does not catch up anymore. Tried 5 times now over the last weeks and giving up at around 4-5 days each. \r\n\r\nDoes the machine not meet todays minimum hardware requirement anymore or is this a major bug?\r\n\r\n#### Backtrace\r\n\r\nlatest block 13 hours ago (!)\r\n\r\nI0818 00:15:26.444933 core/blockchain.go:805] imported  148 receipts in    2.775s. #4169952 [e3f556fc… / 36f4d3c9…]\r\n\r\n...\r\n\r\nlatest header chain 50 minutes ago\r\n\r\nI0818 12:47:45.107445 core/headerchain.go:342] imported    1 headers in   4.954ms. #4173009 [350d1426… / 350d1426…]\r\n\r\n...\r\n\r\ncurrently only importing nothing but state entries\r\n\r\nI0818 13:36:41.103101 eth/downloader/downloader.go:966] imported 172 state entries in   10.009s: processed 10010213, pending at least 129361\r\nI0818 13:36:41.103131 eth/downloader/downloader.go:966] imported 384 state entries in 783.519ms: processed 10010597, pending at least 129361\r\nI0818 13:36:41.103154 eth/downloader/downloader.go:966] imported 381 state entries in    6.963s: processed 10010978, pending at least 129361\r\nI0818 13:36:41.103167 eth/downloader/downloader.go:966] imported  25 state entries in  87.654ms: processed 10011003, pending at least 129360\r\nI0818 13:36:46.014244 eth/downloader/downloader.go:966] imported 384 state entries in    2.482s: processed 10011387, pending at least 127584\r\nI0818 13:36:49.074483 eth/downloader/downloader.go:966] imported 381 state entries in    7.082s: processed 10011768, pending at least 127105\r\nI0818 13:36:49.074553 eth/downloader/downloader.go:966] imported 384 state entries in    7.971s: processed 10012152, pending at least 127105\r\nI0818 13:36:49.074574 eth/downloader/downloader.go:966] imported 384 state entries in    3.772s: processed 10012536, pending at least 127105\r\nI0818 13:36:49.074603 eth/downloader/downloader.go:966] imported 162 state entries in    5.822s: processed 10012698, pending at least 127105\r\nI0818 13:36:49.074622 eth/downloader/downloader.go:966] imported  25 state entries in    4.050s: processed 10012723, pending at least 127105\r\nI0818 13:36:49.074639 eth/downloader/downloader.go:966] imported 381 state entries in    3.060s: processed 10013104, pending at least 127105\r\nI0818 13:36:49.074742 eth/downloader/downloader.go:966] imported  85 state entries in    7.117s: processed 10013189, pending at least 127105\r\nI0818 13:36:49.074765 eth/downloader/downloader.go:966] imported 375 state entries in    2.219s: processed 10013564, pending at least 127105\r\nI0818 13:36:49.074782 eth/downloader/downloader.go:966] imported  87 state entries in    3.915s: processed 10013651, pending at least 127105\r\nI0818 13:36:49.074795 eth/downloader/downloader.go:966] imported  23 state entries in 271.734ms: processed 10013674, pending at least 127104",

    "body": "I am having the exact same issue as Laughing Cabbage has described, also on Ubuntu 16.04, and also stuck on the last few hundred blocks.\r\nI am running geth1.6.7, at the moment. I have also tried versions 1.7.0, 1.6.6 and 1.6.5, with the same issue. I have tried applying --fast, and have tried without it.\r\nWhen I restart geth, it usually gets a few more blocks in, and starts \"downloading\" the chain structure from 0. Downloading is in parenthesis, because when checking the folder into which it should be downloading, the folder access date and time does not change, nor can I find any other folder to which it saves the chain structure to.\r\nLeaving it overnight, will get a chain structure in the millions, but the blocks will still not sync.\r\nSearching the web, I have seen this problem exists for many people, for a very long time, across every platform, and with every version of geth, and no one has come up with any kind of solution. And since I am at best an amateur programmer, I have given up with geth. \r\nI will try parity.io now, hopefully they have allowed people with little and no programming skills to connect to ethereum, and if not, then my solution is to give up on ethereum all together. That will solve the headache this issue is starting to create :-) \r\nI'll check back with geth when in reaches version 2.",

    "body": "You'll probably find it much easier to be on `Parity` (https://parity.io) - the wallet can do a light-mode sync in around 20-30 minutes... this is a good short-to-medium term solution. However, on Mac you need to be on OS X Sierra (or use the brew install instead)\r\n\r\nI think someone needs to re-architect the fast sync in `geth` as the client needs to reach out to more diverse peers when it gets \"stuck\" for long periods of time like this. I have a few ideas, but very limited time, and it really needs to be done (or reviewed) by someone who knows what they are doing :P",

This is only way we have found to sync to run our business we have one employee her job just come in an run sync every day at 8am before we start then can teamviewer that machine.
