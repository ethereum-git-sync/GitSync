  "body": "The full-node I use for walleth-push and the issuETH ChainWatcher always dies after a day or so with SIGKILL.\r\nVersion is 1.7.2 from PPA.\r\nInterestingly this only happens to the main-net node. Never had this problem with the Rinkeby one. This is running through since days.\r\nI just recently added support for main-net - so I cannot say if this is a newly added problem. Was only running a full node on main for longer time since 1.7.2. Perhaps it is also a problem originating in the fact that I run 2 geth instances on the same PC (one for Rinkeby and one for Main). Or it is just coming from the fact that Main has more load.\r\n\r\n```\r\nINFO [10-20|08:16:45] Imported new chain segment               blocks=3  txs=112  mgas=5.298  elapsed=8.991s    mgasps=0.589 number=4390681 hash=a7cb14…df08c8\r\nINFO [10-20|08:17:00] Imported new chain segment               blocks=3  txs=134  mgas=9.949  elapsed=14.606s   mgasps=0.681 number=4390684 hash=6f91a8…14d147\r\nINFO [10-20|08:17:09] Imported new chain segment               blocks=2  txs=116  mgas=7.782  elapsed=9.134s    mgasps=0.852 number=4390686 hash=fa5863…71e998\r\nfish: “geth --datadir=/media/ligi/chai…” terminated by signal SIGKILL (Forced quit)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe node is started like this:\r\n\r\n`geth --datadir=/media/ligi/chains/main/ --syncmode=fast --port \"35555\"  -rpc --rpcaddr 127.0.0.1 --rpcport 9004\r\n`\r\n\r\nEnvironment is a Ubuntu 16.04.3 LTS\r\nWill run the node with increased verbosity now as unfortunately the crash does not yield a lot of info.
