    "body": "Same problem for me. I'm on a DSL connection in Miami, and although I initially connect to around 200-2000 peers, it stalls some time between a few minutes to an hour later, and I'm sitting mining the same block that never changes. I've tried things like --maxpeers \"32\" and --maxpendpeers \"1\", but these options don't seem to be respected in any regard.\n\nEdit: \nAfter specifying(or not) --nat \"extip:local.subnet.address.here\" or --nat \"extip:my.public.address.here\", the socket appears to be listening on 0.0.0.0.\n\nEdit 2:\nTurns out it was properly listening on the \"any\" interface, but a rule on my router was tripped and subsequently dropping the insanely large amount of connections. Is there any way to make it not go completely crazy and flood my connection upon initialization?\n\nEdit 3:\nAfter dropping this rule, things are working a little better, but this is in no way a solution. After an hour, I still only get 1 outbound connection, with ~50-150 inbound.\n\nEdit 4:\nNope. 700 seconds on the same block when the chain is clearly moving on etherchain.org. This is with 1 outbound connection and ~200 inbound.\n",

    "body": "The bug still exists for me, however the problem of the chain being out of sync with many inbound connections has been resolved. The chain used to stall when my outbound connections would dwindle to around 1 or 0 despite having many inbound connections, but now the chain stays synced with 0 outbound, with around 100 inbound connections. This is after running 1.1.0 for about 36 hours, where it used to stall with 1.0.1 around an hour, no matter the number of inbound connections (outbound would always trickle to 0 and inbound connections would not sync). \n\nIn other words, it looks like this is now a non issue if port forwarding is configured properly because the inbound peers are always diligent to sync the chain. The lack of outbound connections still raises an eyebrow though.\n\nEdit: the version I'm actually running is 1.1.0, and I've been running it for a few days which trickled down to only inbound peers, but the chain is still kept up to date.\n",

    "body": "In that log, the original issue where discovery stopped working is no longer present.\n\nBut here's another observation:\nThe log covers 145 seconds of execution. Within that time, there were 8 distinct cases where a block you received had a future timestamp. The error message is a bit cryptic but tells exactly what is going on:\n\n```\nI0126 21:08:41.151871    3260 fetcher.go:771] Peer c9bd41bc3c6ce895: block #910165 [45f51785…] import failed: block time is in the future: BlockFutureErr, 1453860569 > 1453860551\n```\n\nWhat this means is that the block was received at 21:08:41, but had a timestamp of 21:09:29 (1453860569 unix time, your time zone seems to be UTC-5:00) which is not within to allowed maximum of 30s difference.\n\nTo make a long story very short, it looks like your clock is off by a minute.\n",
