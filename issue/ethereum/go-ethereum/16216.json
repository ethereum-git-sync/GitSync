  "body": "Hello,\r\n\r\nAfter numerous attempts to sync geth and parity \"fast\" nodes on my system with no success a whisper of hope was offered to me when a geth \"light\" node just magically synced within minutes. Unfortunately the hope didn't last long as it appears that \"light\" mode doesn't have any way to receive pending transactions. Am I wrong? If not - are there any plans to include this feature or is this technically infeasible? :)\r\n\r\nWhats I've tried: used RPC methods: \"eth_newPendingTransactionFilter\" in conjunction with \"eth_getFilterChanges\" and there were no filter changes ever reported. \"txpool_content\" also seems to be empty all the time. I will provide code examples if this feature is in fact somewhat supported.\r\n\r\nThank you.\r\n\r\n#### System information\r\n\r\nGeth version: 1.8.1.  Same on nightly\r\nOS & Version: Mac OS X\r\n\r\n#### Expected behaviour\r\n\r\nget some pending transctions\r\n\r\n#### Actual behaviour\r\n\r\nno pending transactions to be seen",

    "body": "A light client only maintains its own transactions. It cannot maintain a pool of pending transactions, since it cannot check the validity of those transactions (without the state, which is costly to pull from the network for every single tx).\r\n\r\nI don't think this is a use case we will ever be able to support. Accessing any \"pending\" data with a light client is already problematic because the result would depend on which server is answering you (since nodes in the network may see different pending states).\r\n\r\nSorry to say, but I don't think light client will help you here.",

    "body": "@karalabe I understand and agree with your explanation above, but would that be technically possible to enable this with a quick patch for a light node? Eg. consider cases when mempool tx validity is not mission-critical and user just needs to peek into the mempool - then syncing full node would be an overkill (time/resource-wise) Or is it functionally not implemented for light nodes?
