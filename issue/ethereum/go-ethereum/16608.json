    "body": "**TL;DR: See the last paragraph**\r\n\r\nI've just experienced a similar issue. My situation was that I needed to use web3 1.0 websocket on my node side to connect to my local geth client.\r\n\r\nAfter some investigations, my conclusion is that neither(geth or web3) is behaving incorrectly. Instead what one needs to do is just to specifiy origin on the web3 side. I'd like to share some research on this issue. Hope it can clear up some confusion that I also had.\r\n\r\n0. Basically, `origin '' not allowed on WS-RPC interface` is caused because websocket's `Origin` header is not specified, while geth client requires it([default settings is to only accept connections from `http://localhost`, if not specified with `--wsorigins` option](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/blob/master/rpc/websocket.go#L99)).\r\n\r\n1. websocket's `Origin` is a header set by the browser. Why does such header exists in websocket protocol and why geth asks for it? This is to protect possible abuse and hijacking from other sites since WebSockets are not restrained by the same-origin policy.(see [this](https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/115716/is-the-origin-header-really-useful-for-securing-a-websocket) and [this](https://www.christian-schneider.net/CrossSiteWebSocketHijacking.html)) But also, note that `Origin` header is subject to be manipulated since it's only a header added by the browser.\r\n\r\n2.  The [`WebsocketProvider` that web3 1.0 provides now](https://github.com/ethereum/web3.js/tree/1.0/packages/web3-providers-ws) is a websocket for the node(dependent on [WebSocket-Node](https://github.com/theturtle32/WebSocket-Node)). You can use it on the browser side too, but note that even if you pass the `Origin` header onto the provider(see final code section), browser will automatically override that value with the current host. So when connecting from a browser, what you need to do is to add correctly the expected host onto geth's `--wsorigins`.\r\n\r\n3. On the other hand, when this websocket provider is used in node, `Origin` header may not have a valid meaning, since the websocket connection from a node process is not really in a user-agent scenario where the script is provided by the domain. From [the WebSocket-Node documentation](https://github.com/theturtle32/WebSocket-Node/blob/master/docs/WebSocketClient.md#connectrequesturl-requestedprotocols-origin-headers-requestoptions):\r\n\r\n> `origin` is an optional field that can be used in user-agent scenarios to identify the page containing any scripting content that caused the connection to be requested. (**This seems unlikely in node.. probably should leave it null most of the time.**)\r\n\r\nThis is why the [web3 code](https://github.com/ethereum/web3.js/blob/1.0/packages/web3-providers-ws/src/index.js#L78) left it `undefined` by default. But still, **you can set the `Origin` header with the `options` object**(which is the 2nd param of `WebsocketProvider` constructor) with `headers` > `Origin` key, [which will](https://github.com/ethereum/web3.js/blob/1.0/packages/web3-providers-ws/src/index.js#L72) [eventually](https://github.com/theturtle32/WebSocket-Node/blob/master/lib/WebSocketClient.js#L178) [written into the `Origin` header](https://github.com/theturtle32/WebSocket-Node/blob/master/lib/WebSocketClient.js#L190).\r\n\r\nTo sum up, one can just go with `--wsorigins *` option for geth if security is not of much concern, or rather specify `origin` header explicitly with some meaningful string(or the actual host) on the web3 websocket provider and pass the value onto geth's `--wsorigins`. One easy option is to set the `Origin` header as `http://localhost` on web3 ws-provider, and run geth without `--wsorigins` since geth defaults to accept connections from `http://localhost`, which is the handier equivalent of what @Bunjin did.\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n```js\r\nconst wsProvider = new Web3.providers.WebsocketProvider(\"ws://localhost:8546\", {\r\n  headers: {\r\n    Origin: \"http://localhost\"\r\n  }\r\n});\r\nweb3 = new Web3(wsProvider);\r\n```\r\n\r\n@vzts",

So if the server receives a request without the Origin header, it is safe to respond, because it is a request coming from a **non browser environment** where the header can be set arbitrarily. Geth should be fixed and just respond normally when not finding a header instead of enforcing this hack to set the header by hand.\r\n\r\nI come here because I stumbled on this while trying to get my tests running from node. It is very annoying to have to add such stuff to the production codebase just to make some tests run.",

It is a valid solution and I am using it:\r\n\r\nWhen you run this (please note I changed the value for `Origin`)\r\n```js\r\nconst wsProvider = new Web3.providers.WebsocketProvider(\"ws://localhost:8546\", {\r\n  headers: {\r\n    Origin: \"http://invalid.host\"\r\n  }\r\n});\r\nweb3 = new Web3(wsProvider);\r\n```\r\ntwo different things happen depending on where it is run:\r\n- If you run this code in the browser on `http://localhost:3000` the origin header will be set to `http://localhost:3000`\r\n- If you run this code in node, the origin header will be set to `http://invalid.host`\r\n\r\nThe connection from the javascript run with node will only be allowed, when `http://invalid.host` is whitelisted in geth with the `--wsorigins http://localhost:3000,http://invalid.host` flag.\r\n\r\n**BUT** when you run the code like so **in Node**:\r\n```js\r\nconst wsProvider = new Web3.providers.WebsocketProvider(\"ws://localhost:8546\")\r\nweb3 = new Web3(wsProvider);\r\n```\r\nthen the origin header will be missing and geth will discard the connection to \"protect against third party hijacking\". The thing is: If the header is missing, it is safe to allow the connection: The \"attacker\" must be accessing the endpoint from a **non browser environment** (because otherwise the browser would have set the origin header). That means that the attacker can set any header she/he wants. So then the hacker just puts `http://localhost:3000` as the origin and gets access to the node. So instead of **enforcing the correct header** geth should **enforce a correct header, iff the header is present** (note the second \"f\"). If no header is present, just allow the access, there is no possible protection anyhow.\r\n\r\nSo back to the problem at hand:\r\n- Your solution is a good workaround. For example (as in my case) to run headless tests with web3 in a node environment.\r\n- It is not the best solution, because the best solution would require to fix the behaviour of geth, then your workaround is no longer necessary.\r\n\r\nSo I am making the point that someone did not really think things through when implementing the current behaviour of geth and this should be fixed instead of forcing everyone to use this workaround.\r\n",

    "body": "@holiman Are you done thinking about this?  😉 This is causing problems with Augur and the current workaround is to tell users to do `--ws-origns '*'` which is not secure for them.\r\n\r\nYour latest comment is correct, if no origin is present then it means the connecting client is not attempting to protect the user for cross origin attacks, most likely because it isn't a browser.  There is no situation where a client would submit no origin and expect to be protected against cross origin attacks since the mechanism for protecting against cross origin attacks is by supplying an Origin to the server and trusting the server to help you out with the protection.",
