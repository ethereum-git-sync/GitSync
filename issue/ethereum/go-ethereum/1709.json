(Just make the above JSON object a string by wrapping it in quotes and passing it to AJAX.\n\nAlso, there never seems to be any mention of what the \"id\" parameter does, so I just left it at 1. What does it do? The [JSON RPC specifications](http://www.jsonrpc.org/specification#response_object) seem to treat it as an internal use item. (Such as a way to identify the transaction with the server if the client sends multiple transmissions asynchronously.) I've never used JSON RPC before, though I know AJAX. Am I correct in my assumption?\n",

But there's also nuanced functionality when the id is missing, the request is considered \"notification only\" and not in need of response form the server.

We don't have jquery set up, we don't work with html/js/jquery to easily just paste something like that in and have it run. Also saying to \"just wrap the object in a string\" is very non obvious if you're used to a different programming envrionment/world/concepts. This is why @tgerring was asking for a cURL example that we can paste into a console and jsut see what the issue is.\n\nIf you want to go down the HTML/jQuery path, that's also ok, but then please write up a full working example (all boilerplate included), and also one where the thing fails. I don't want to start reading up on jQuery and waste time assembling an HTML file just to test an RPC call.\n",
