  "body": "I have a private ethereum of version v1.7.3\r\nProblem scenario\r\n  I have two nodes,The first normal mining，The second only synchronizes the data of another node, not mining，When I use an account transfer (nonce=0) that has never been traded and submitted to the not mining node, the trade will remain in txpool.But there is no such transaction in the txpool of the first node.I use the account in the node that is mining to send another transaction, so that it will be executed. \r\nThe issue \r\nWhen nonce=0, I want to know why the same account initiated the transaction without mining the node why not broadcast the transaction, but always exists with txpool\r\n\r\nThe txpool of the node being mined\r\n\r\n![微信图片_20190604145438](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/42377006/58857924-eedc8c80-86d8-11e9-938c-0a637839bb41.png)\r\n\r\nTxpool of a node that has not been mined but is synchronizing\r\n\r\n![微信图片_20190604145429](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/42377006/58857968-10d60f00-86d9-11e9-918c-4adf145b54ba.png)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe account that executed the transaction submits the transaction to the unmined node (nonce!=0), and its transaction will be executed, but when nonce = 0, it will not be executed unless the transaction is submitted to the mining node.\r\n\r\nCan anyone tell me why？\r\n",

Also, miners can set their own gas prices to accept transactions, make sure your price is above the miner's allowance.\r\n\r\nHello，I found that my problem was solved in [this submission](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/commit/e8f229b82ef99213f8f84b8a71f752b236024494), but I still don't understand it. \r\nProblem ：\r\nTwo nodes, the first node is mining, the second node is connected to the first node, the data is synchronized, and the second node is not mined. I have an account with balance, this account has never been initiated. After trading (nonce = 0), use it to connect to the second node to initiate a transaction, gaslimit and gasprice are enough, then the transaction is always in the txpool of the second node, and the first node in the txpool There is no.\r\n\r\nI checked a lot of information, there is no such information, I hope you can help me.  thanks\r\n\r\n",
