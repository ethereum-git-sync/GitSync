    "body": "> - If a node cannot be verified, flag the missing hash/path for download.\r\n> - Continue until trie is done\r\n\r\nWhile walking the trie, I think that the only error that will occur, in practice, is that we find that resolving a certain hash fails: a missing trie node. At that point, we cannot continue walking that path further down, so unless we fetch it on the fly, we cannot \"continue until done\".\r\n\r\n(Theoretically, I guess we could also find that `hash(rlp(node)) != expected_hash`, but I suspect we won't run into that. I guess it could happen if a flle system corruption actually flipped a bit in a leaf node, e.g modding a byte in the balance or nonce-field or whatever)\r\n\r\nSo perhaps a better solution is to fix the trie while walking it, otherwise the user would have to re-run the same 10+ hour-long process again and again for every missing trie node on the same path\r\n",
