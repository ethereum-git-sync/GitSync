Finally I gave up. \nI think you should issue a warning, that this version is broken beyond reasonable patience. It has cost me much time.\n\nThat is relevant because the 1.2.2.0 is the newest 'choco install geth-stable' \nwhich linked from 'ethereum wiki windows install' https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/wiki/Installation-instructions-for-Windows \nwhich is the top 1 result for \"google ethereum windows\" https://www.google.de/search?q=ethereum+windows\n\nPerhaps you should delete the whole chocolatey Geth package - or simply upgrade it to a newer version.\n\nThanks.\n:-)\n\nTL;DR: \n- **version 1.2.2.0 is broken!**\n- So you need to take action and remove (or upgrade) the geth chocolatey package. \n- Your wiki is misleading. Google favors it.\n- with **version 1.3.2** from https://ethereum.org/cli ... syncing seems to be working flawlessly, in one go, without any restart from #696901 to now #731660. \n",
