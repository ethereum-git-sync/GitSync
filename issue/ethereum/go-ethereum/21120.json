If you are entering networking territory, just spin up a proper private network. Dev mode isn't meant for that and we should not make it smarter than it's supposed to be.",

I don't have any need for the networking, it's just that `networkId` is the only parameter in the command line that looked relevant. As I understand it, setting a custom genesis would be undoing a bunch of parameters that `dev` mode provides. \r\n\r\nPut simply, I'm just looking for a way to use a different chainId with dev mode.
