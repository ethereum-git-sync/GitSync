  "body": "There are so many DeFi projects now that getting them all setup inside a devnet is complicated and very fragile.\r\n\r\nA pattern that is [growing in popularity](https://medium.com/@iamdefinitelyahuman/ethereum-mainnet-testing-with-python-and-brownie-82a61dee0222) is using `ganache-cli --fork`. This lets us deploy our own contracts and test transactions in a private test network built on top of another network's state (usually mainnet).\r\n\r\nWhile `ganache-cli --fork` has been a great help in getting my tests running quickly, over the last few weeks I have been running into several bugs in ganache that are making it difficult to fully test my contracts. Being a production client, I think that having a `--fork` flag in geth would be a lot more reliable way to test things.\r\n\r\n#### Expected behaviour\r\n\r\nThere are a few ways that I can see this working, but one way could look something like this:\r\n\r\n`geth --fork mainnet@$BLOCKNUM --fork-unlock ANYADDRESS --fork-fund SOMEADDRESS`\r\n\r\nThis would launch a node that fast syncs mainnet up to block `$BLOCKNUM`. Once it reaches that block, it hard forks to switch to a POA archive node with itself as the only signer. Blocks could either be mined on a timer or mined whenever a pending transaction is received.\r\n\r\nIt should also be easy to connect a second geth node to this forked node. This will make it simple to test various load-balancing strategies.\r\n\r\nThe switch to POA (or some other non-POW mining) is important since following mainnet's difficulty would make mining very difficult.\r\n\r\nThe node should also unlock any address and accept transactions for them without valid signatures. Similar to funding accounts in `genesis.json`, `--fork` should also be able fund addresses with configurable amounts of ETH. This will let us modify the mainnet contracts however we might need for our testing.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Actual behaviour\r\n\r\nIt is currently possible to start geth with `--dev`, but that is a fresh chain without any mainnet state.\r\n\r\nI don't see any way to import mainnet blocks into this `--dev` network.\r\n\r\nAlso, if anyone can think of a way to do this today without having to modify geth, please let me know.",

It _might_ be possible, in some circumstances, if you happen to find an archive node which has old state. Otherwise, fast-sync syncs to whatever is the 'highest' block among your peers, and even that is not stable -- we have to move the 'pivot' point while the sync is ongoing, since our peer is pruning state as time goes by, and we can't rely on state older than `128` blocks to be available. \r\n\r\nFor full-sync, this is trivial though. \r\n\r\n2.

    "body": "> While ganache-cli --fork has been a great help in getting my tests running quickly, over the last few weeks I have been running into several bugs in ganache that are making it difficult to fully test my contracts. Being a production client, I think that having a --fork flag in geth would be a lot more reliable way to test things.\r\n\r\nI think it would be better to focus on getting `ganache` to work, as they're already pursuing this feature.
