Use go-ethereum v1.9.12\r\n2. Write code that depends on `abi.U256()`\r\n3. Attempt to upgrade to go-ethereum v1.9.23\r\n4. Find that `abi.U256()` was removed for no obvious reason: https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/commit/ab72803e6f171d6fc2c40419c833853b7c122f6f#diff-baa94fd18f34eadd3684559252ba85328c6da713e079ccc39de383ecbd6950d6L40-L45\r\n5. Find out that a number of your dependencies also depend on `abi.U256()`\r\n\r\nAs another example, https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/21043 changes the behaviour of `estimateGas()` in a breaking way when a non-zero gasPrice is specified. This should not go in a patch release!\r\n\r\nSee https://semver.org/ for reference.",

We will be more careful regarding such API changes in the future.\r\n\r\nPlease note that certain packages in go-ethereum cannot always remain backwards-compatible because their APIs need to be adapted to changes in the ethereum protocol.

I completely understand that breaking changes are sometimes needed, the important thing is that breaking changes should always lead to a major version bump, that way it is less surprising to developers. Unfortunately, for now I am stuck on v1.9.12 since upgrading will require a long and tedious process of ensuring all my dependencies work with v1.9.23 and re-compiling the contract bindings for v1.9.23, which I do not have time for right now.\r\n\r\nClosing since I don't think there is any immediate action go-ethereum devs can take to remedy this situation, just wanted to make you aware.",
