  "body": "The documents such as [web3py](https://web3py.readthedocs.io/en/v4.0.0/web3.admin.html) and [web3js](https://web3js.readthedocs.io/en/v2.0.0-alpha/web3-eth-admin.html) didn't explain what  `network.inbound` and `network.outbound` means.\r\n\r\nThere are two plausible explanation.\r\n\r\n1. For a peer, `network.inbound` means that the peer accepts inbound connection.\r\n2. For a peer, `network.inbound` means that peer is connected to the current node through a inbound connection.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure about you but I feel that two intuitions have equal chance of being true, so we can't pass it as a case of \"self-explanatory - no document needed\".\r\n\r\nI experimented† with both cases and found that 2 is the correct answer. But for someone who look at peers and wonders how many of them are 'selfish' (not accepting incoming connections or behind NAT firewall), looking at how many have `nework.inbound == true` seem to be the most intuitive way to go - they would be in for a surprise.\r\n\r\n## †How I experimented  ##\r\n\r\n\r\nExample of both true and false are found in the following screen transcript:\r\n\r\n````\r\n> admin.peers\r\n…\r\n {\r\n    caps: [\"eth/62\", \"eth/63\"],\r\n    enode: \"enode://1855ff4c8d07db6c311f2940493739fd14d5d47b9e52f0e4161a4efef631a1dd4017d18efdf915373fb16e3182d4b1df212fab95c29d23bea2bfcdf22f8ffb57@46.105.78.246:46360\",\r\n    id: \"ff476e8a4664654dc9d415dffda42a640c75aa305c3c4d53d4fac4e15ad90a81\",\r\n    name: \"ethereumjs-devp2p/v2.5.1/linux-x64/nodejs\",\r\n    network: {\r\n      inbound: true,\r\n      localAddress: \"192.168.47.109:30303\",\r\n      remoteAddress: \"46.105.78.246:46360\",\r\n      static: false,\r\n      trusted: false\r\n    },\r\n    protocols: {\r\n      eth: {\r\n        difficulty: 17179869184,\r\n        head: \"0xd4e56740f876aef8c010b86a40d5f56745a118d0906a34e69aec8c0db1cb8fa3\",\r\n        version: 63\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n}, {\r\n    caps: [\"eth/63\", \"eth/64\", \"eth/65\"],\r\n    enode: \"enode://dc79daf8d1b085f32279bfff419eb884a234b55927c577e26f692a5c68c59cf7359e83a62e79ab9f9b0dcbc703c9b5fc8afd666feec165a70385a01a78c075be@173.249.6.189:30301\",\r\n    id: \"ff9a9ea0f4d5019497211cf6b98c98c86adc290d54f4475cb06725e5bba57e85\",\r\n    name: \"Geth/v1.9.24-stable-cc05b050/linux-amd64/go1.15.5\",\r\n    network: {\r\n      inbound: false,\r\n      localAddress: \"192.168.47.109:51182\",\r\n      remoteAddress: \"173.249.6.189:30301\",\r\n      static: true,\r\n      trusted: false\r\n    },\r\n    protocols: {\r\n      eth: {\r\n        difficulty: 1.9054455443752023e+22,\r\n        head: \"0x4aa4ac671dcd5a04179a8382e39453972382fb317a184d9ccd86ffa561f1cb3f\",\r\n        version: 65\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n}]\r\n````\r\n\r\nGiven my node listens to \"192.168.47.109:30303\", the first peer should be connected through an inbound tcp connection and the second should be connected through an outbound tcp connection. Then we have the first with `network.inboud: true` and the second `false`, hence I conclude `network.inboud` is a property of the connection to the peer, not a property of the peer. ",
