  "body": "# Rationale\r\n\r\nAt the moment the `ethclient` package supports websockets connection to target servers. Websockets can occasionally experience issues that basically require a \"rehup\" of the connection otherwise the connection will permanently return errors.\r\n\r\nI experienced this last night when one of my services returned the following error:\r\n```\r\nwebsocket: close 1006 (abnormal closure): unexpected EOF\r\n```\r\n\r\nI had no choice but to shutdown the service, and restart it it. This is very undesirable in production workloads, and I dont see any easy way to \"rehup\" the connection.\r\n\r\n# Implementation\r\n\r\nI have no ideas as to how to implement this, maybe some sort of post-request processing handler that allows you to specify what errors that are received which should trigger a \"rehup\"? I would be willing to implement this.",
