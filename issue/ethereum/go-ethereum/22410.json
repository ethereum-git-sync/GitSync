I know that this has been reiterated dozens of times, I've looked through all Github tickets and know that IOPS, CPU and RAM requirements are very high (especially former). The only reason I'm posting this once again is that i3.xlarge is very decent machine, and it still only gives me 10 blocks/sec (so I estimate full sync will take like... weeks? months?). Am I missing something?",

    "body": "Another thing is that during the initial sync you don't want to have that many peers. \r\nManaging these peers will reduce your sync speed. So you would want to run with maybe `--maxpeers 20` until your node is synced and then increase to `--maxpeers 500`. If you want to support the ethereum network, you can also enable `--light.serve 100` to enable one core to serve light clients.\r\n\r\nWill close this issue for now, Feel free to open another one if you found a bug. Generally we prefer that you use the ethereum stackexchange for usage advice",

As I've said I am setting up the full node simply to do it \"right blockchain way\" and ensure everything is correct.\r\n\r\nThe issue is not 1200 transactions per seconds (that's around 8 blocks which is fine) but:\r\n1. On EBS SSD it's around 40-50 transactions per second. So ANY synchronization way wouldn't work as it can't even keep up with network\r\n2. On a very powerful dedicated server from hetzner i get only 1 block per second. That's enough to keep up with network for now, but is quite slow\r\n\r\nPlease check the links - I've been expecting much higher performance than even on i3.xlarge,but it is 8 times slower on bare metal. Is there something that I am missing? ",

    "body": "Well, sorry again for spamming, but looks like I've found the problem.\r\n\r\nSo in my case I've been using Docker with cpu/ram limits. Ram limit was not enough and it has been using swap. While that's already enough for slow performance It has been even worse: due to kernel limitations swap limits didn't propagate to the container so it has been continuously trying to allocate too much memory and dying with OOM that restarted sync over and over doing it slowly due to using swap... Quite challenging. Thanks for your help anyway ",
