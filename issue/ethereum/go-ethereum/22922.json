    "body": "After the upgrade, Geth node needs to generate the snapshot which essentially traverses the entire state trie and it's really expensive, especially for the disk IO. And what's more because you are running the archive node which has a super large database, so the IO cost is even higher(slow disk read).\r\n\r\nWe had a bunch of optimizations for the snapshot generation, but it requires a fresh new snap sync. So it's not suitable for your use case.\r\n\r\nI would suggest to disable the snapshot for your use case. Any opinions @holiman @karalabe ?",

    "body": "This is an annoying thing indeed. I'd still say archive node should also have snapshots, since they are a DoS defense mechanism, but I do see that it take a large toll to generate it and there's no clear way to make it faster (vs. snap syncing a full node).\r\n\r\nExport and import isn't a particularly bad idea, but relying on \"extra\" out-of-protocol steps is a bit unfriendly. Even for power users it's probably very hard to remember and do correctly. Disabling the snapshots works for now, but we wanted to drop that flag, so it's not an obvious solution either. Will need to ponder about this a bit more.",

    "body": "It's inefficient to do block processing at the same time as generation. Normally, after a sync, it's only a handful of blocks which are imported _during_ generation, which gives the generator only a few hundred millisecond to run before being interrrupted again. And after that, the generator can work for 14 seconds before it's interrupted next time. If you're falling further behind, that means that you're stuck in this poor-performance-case. \r\n\r\nI think one problem with only letting the generator execute short bursts of time is that each time it starts anew, it needs to construct new iterators. So, aside from more drastic fixes such as what Gary suggested, it might be worth a shot to see if the speed improves by shutting off the peers. If you have a live node which you don't want to restart, you could e.g. set maxPeers to zero, or netrestrict to localhost. Once it has chugged through the backlog, it will do _only_ generation, and once that's done, you can hook it up to peers again. \r\n\r\nYMMV, but it would be interesting to know what effect that has on your node.
