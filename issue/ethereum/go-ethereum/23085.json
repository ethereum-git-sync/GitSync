  "body": "I'm syncing a geth archival node and the syncing is becoming progressively slower. Current sync status is block ~11.7M/12.6M and syncing 1 block every 2 seconds or 60-100 transactions per second. I have been syncing for 9 weeks so far. At the current rate of progress it will take another 3 weeks, but I am concerned that the sync could become slow enough to never reach the tip.\r\n\r\nCommand I'm running is geth --syncmode full --gcmode archive --txlookuplimit=0 --cache.preimages --datadir /datadrive --cache 128000 --snapshot=false\r\n\r\nI'm running my node on Azure with a Standard E16as_v4 (16 vcpus, 128 GiB memory) instance and 16TB premium SSD storage attached disk. OS is Linux (ubuntu 18.04).\r\n\r\nI am struggling to understand what the bottleneck is. I have tried connecting to new peers from https://etherscan.io/nodetracker, optimizing caching, running on a faster disk, and running with more RAM. The performance data I can see does not suggest any particular problem (CPU, RAM, IOPS, IO bandwidth, queue depth, etc.).",

    "body": "Maybe try giving it more RAM (with `--cache` in megabytes), like over 30GB which seems to be where it caps at for me no matter how much I allow it to use. \r\n\r\nAlso, I'm not for sure on this, but maybe try messing around with the `--maxpeers` option to reduce the number of peers you're connected to, which may help in reducing how many blocks your node has to send out just while you sync. As you can see from my [metrics](https://snapshot.raintank.io/dashboard/snapshot/5jiENblUP5laHyrgMigO6Yx087DVxmgf?orgId=2), I only have around `16` peers connected at a time, and although it still isn't incredibly fast, I have been syncing faster than 1 block per minute. Good luck, and I hope those suggestions are helpful.",
