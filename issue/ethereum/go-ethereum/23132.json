Subscribe to newHeads\r\n2. For each block header, submit batch request (ethclient.BatchCallContext) with batch of `eth_getTransactionReceipt` or `debug_traceTransaction` for every transaction.\r\n3. Optional: For Golang RPC client, add logging of raw resp.Result in `rpc/client.go` right before json.Unmarshal (https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/blob/master/rpc/client.go#L391)\r\n4. Wait about 100-300 blocks\r\n5. Observe NULLs/garbage in resp.result bytes instead of expected replies, and/or JSON unmarshal error\r\n#### Backtrace\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nWhen submitting logs: please submit them as text and not screenshots.",
