I'm deliberately performing large queries on my node and the network transport isn't a bottleneck, so I'd like to configure my RPC client to accept much larger response sizes (it has no problem when using an IPC socket when running locally on the node) without returning an error:\r\n\r\n> websocket: read limit exceeded\r\n\r\nI haven't tried the HTTP connection, but that has [an even smaller limit](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/blob/master/rpc/http.go#L35) of 5MB and is reportedly slower, which doesn't work for my case in which I'm making millions of calls to my node.\r\n\r\n# Implementation\r\n\r\nAs long as it's somehow configurable, I can't say what the best implementation would be (only been writing Go for a week or so).",

    "body": "I'm pulling logs out of my Eth node for a range of contract addresses, getting their receipts and getting the blocks that they were confirmed in so that I can calculate the gas used (`receipt.GasUsed`) for all of those contracts per day (`block.Time()`) vs how many ERC-20/ERC-721 and ERC-1155 `Transfer` events (`log.Topics`) had taken place.\r\n\r\nI've been using GraphQL for these queries since of course it makes it easy to tie the three types together into a single query, but sadly it's not easy to find a hosted Eth node that provides GraphQL (Infura no longer do it without paying for a whole node  at $300+/m)\r\n\r\nThis obviously means I'm making millions of queries, so I'm using batch queries for this (IIRC, this means sometimes grabbing a few thousand receipts in a single query). Understandably this puts a reasonable load on my Eth node, but since it's dedicated to this task it's not an issue. As I mentioned, this works well when connected over IPC but what would ordinarily be fine and (relatively) reasonable over a websocket too, is artificially limited by this fixed 15MB limit on the websocket client.",
