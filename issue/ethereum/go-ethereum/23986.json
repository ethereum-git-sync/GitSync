  "body": "I'm running txpool statistics to see at which fee-level transactions are processed over time, see https://jochen-hoenicke.de/queue/#ETH,24h,count.  For this I run with `--txpool.globalslots=150000` to ensure I see most of the pending transactions.\r\n\r\nI recently updated to geth 1.10.13 and you can see that almost no transactions are added to the txpool since then.  If I understand the new logic correctly, it will never add any transaction that pays less than the base fee.  This may be not intended as it means that when the base fee drops, miners do not already have the low fee transactions in their pool but now have to wait for them to be resent over the network.  Also it is a bit inconsistent, since the low fee transactions are not purged when the base fee rises but no new transactions are added below the base fee even if they pay more than the transactions already in the pool. \r\n\r\nIMHO for txpool admission it may make more sense to use the maximum fee instead of the current effective fee, since this doesn't change over time.  This is also what I use in my txpool graphs.",

    "body": "I would suggest to have two criteria for txpool admission: (1) the maximum priority fee should be greater than the gas price set in the config (1 Gwei is the default, but miners can choose a higher or lower value) and (2) the maximum total gas price should be greater than a dynamically chosen price to keep number of queued transactions to the target size.  This would roughly give the pre eip-1559 behaviour except that miners ignore eip-1559 transaction that pay them too little priority fee.  It would ensure that the miners always have the transactions in the pool that are most likely to be mined by them in the future.\r\n",

    "body": "> (1) the maximum priority fee should be greater than the gas price set in the config\r\n\r\nFrom my observations this is how it used to work before the change. However having this parameter on 1 Gwei caused the txpool to be flooded with many (non useful) low gas legacy transactions (which is why the change was made). \r\n\r\nI believe that the ideal purpose of the `-pricelimit` parameter should be to be able to set a floor level for the **'effective' or 'actual' gas price** of a transaction to be admitted to the pool. This would match the intended pre-EIP1559 filtering behavior. I consider the 'effective' gas price to be the `BaseFee` + `MaxPriorityFee`. However since the `BaseFee` varies each block it perhaps makes the admission logic too complicated.\r\n\r\nTherefore I believe that the next best option would be to test the `-pricelimit` against the `MaxFee` and to simultaneously introduce a new EIP1559 specific variable called `-MinPriorityFee` or `-PriorityFeeLimit`.\r\nBoth could have a default value of 1 Gwei. I believe that these parameters are more intuitive and provide the flexibility that is needed.\r\n\r\n\r\n",

    "body": "The effective gas price level should only be chosen dynamically.  If you set it to something like 65, it would work fine at the moment but it wouldn't have enqueued any transaction in September and it would have enqueued 30k transactions in April.  You don't want users to continuously reconfigure their nodes.  So choosing it automatically such that the number of queued transactions hits the desired size is probably best and this is how geth worked pre-1559. In June when the base fee was 4 Gwei [edit: base fee didn't exists in June, but it would have been 4 Gwei] it would be stupid for a miner to not accept a 24 Gwei transaction.  Currently even accepting all 50 Gwei transactions would just bloat your txpool.\r\n\r\nThe problem with just looking at the priority fee (as the current implementation does) is that it changes faster than the transaction pool.  So during a nft sale you may have a base fee peak of 1000 Gwei but only 50 transaction in total above 500 Gwei.  So why shouldn't you accept a transaction that pays over 500 Gwei? It's very likely to be the most profitable transaction in the next few minutes.  It's current priority fee is -500 though so using the current priority fee as a metric would not work.  If geth was consistent and removed all tx that it wouldn't accept into the pool, then it would currently clear the txpool completely whenever a block that is not 200% full is produced.\r\n\r\nSo my suggestion is to use a dynamic max gas price limit that keeps the pool to the desired size (e.g. 4000 tx), and use user set pricelimit with the priority fee only to discard transactions that don't pay the desired priority fee for the miner.\r\n",

With the old code it will then do what you want, namely only retain the 10k transactions with the highest max fee cap.  I use 150k just to get most of the pending transactions so I know roughly how many low fee transactions exists.  But 150k will give you also the 4 Gwei transactions.",

I don't quite recall why I had to add them in the past but now I'm seeing the behavior that you have described. This is indeed sufficient for most applications. \r\nI might have added the `-txpool.pricelimit` for performance reasons (no processing of low gas transactions).\r\n\r\nI think my point about the `-txpool.pricelimit` remains though. I didn't find the parameter meaningful pre geth 1.10.13 since it seemed to test the pricelimit against Type0.GasPrice or Type2.MaxPriorityFee (which are not the same thing at all). So I'm not sure the best way is to revert it.\r\n\r\nMy original issue remains (pre & post geth 1.10.13) but then again I'm not an expert and I'm not sure if I'm viewing the `pricelimit` in the right way . I also don't know Go so I think this is better suited for someone with more knowledge than me to discuss further.\r\n\r\n",
