    "body": "@fjl This may actually be the log we've been so keen on receiving.\n\nThey show that the node manages to place itself and itself only in its discovery table, which results in only asking itself for remote nodes, which seems to return itself again. This results in some weird scenario where the bootnodes aren't consulted any more and we constantly self-discover and self-connect.\n\nAt least this is the scenario that looks likely to me if you check that the single remaining node at the end of the log is actually the current node's enode ide (if you check the start of the log).\n",
