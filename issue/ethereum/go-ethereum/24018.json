    "body": "Well, if you set the node up so that it's exposed to the internet, and anyone who happens to find it can send transactions from it without any form of authentication, it's hardly surprising that someone found it and is sending transactions from it. \r\nMy recommendation is to stick with the defaults, and if you need to open it up, you have to figure out how you can do so without ruining the security model. Solutions can include persistent ssh tunnels, VPN, or simply let the sealer seal (and nothing else)  but not expose any rpc interface. ",
