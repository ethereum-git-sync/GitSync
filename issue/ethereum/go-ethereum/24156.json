  "body": "# Rationale\r\n\r\nRight now `geth` does not offer a hashrate metric for GPU work, only CPU work.\r\n\r\nGiven the state of ethereum and the mainnet blockchain any CPU work at this point is obsolete. \r\n\r\nWould it be possible to imagine a mechanism in which a subset of GPU miners could report their current hashrate back to a centralized `geth` process?\r\nIt would then be possible for `geth` to calculate a hashrate average or subset of hashrate averages over time. (Similar to how `/proc/loadavg` works on a handful of intervals.)\r\n\r\nIt wouldn't be impossible to build another tool outside the scope of `geth` that would accomplish the same goal. However I do think there is value in using `geth` to track this. I can also see how having miner metrics reported back into the `geth` tool breaks the entire \"decentralized\" model as this approach would be in favor of centralizing the metrics.\r\n\r\n# Implementation\r\n\r\nAt a glance it seems we would need the following: \r\n\r\n 1. A standardized RPC in which GPU miners could report metrics back to `geth`\r\n 2. Features plumbed through the various miners such as `ethminer` that would concurrently report the metrics over the new RPC.\r\n\r\n# Considerations\r\n\r\nRight now GPU miners connect to `geth` using [stratum](https://braiins.com/stratum-v2). My research leads me to believe that reporting GPU hashrate over stratum isn't currently supported (Maybe I am wrong? Maybe it should be supported?). \r\n\r\nThis assumption is why I believe we would need a new RPC. The implications of this new RPC would be a new outbound connection from each of the miners back to `geth`. The amount of connections and TCP ports could add up quickly. This can be problematic as we learned with Kubernetes and its dependency on `iptables` to manage these bi-directional connections.",
