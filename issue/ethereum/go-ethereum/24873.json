  "body": "# Rationale\r\n\r\nCurrent code does [a full memory snapshot for every execution step](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/blob/440c9fcf75d9d5383b72646a65d5e21fa7ab6a26/eth/tracers/logger/logger.go#L167).\r\n\r\nWhile for storage, [it only snapshots storage when the opcode accesses storage](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/blob/440c9fcf75d9d5383b72646a65d5e21fa7ab6a26/eth/tracers/logger/logger.go#L183) (SLOAD & SSTORE here).\r\n\r\nSo my proposal: only snapshot the full memory when the opcode updates memory. If not, we directly set memory in StructLog to empty slice.   Since evm cannot really free memory, when a StructLog of step contains empty memory, we know this means the step does not update memory, memory stays the same like previous step.\r\n\r\nReason for this proposal: When EnableMemory = true, if we trace a mainnet block, it costs several minutes but still failed even in a server running geth with 64GiB memory. If this proposal is applied, much fewer steps are needed to take a full snapshot of memory, so tracing will cost less time and memory.\r\n\r\nbackwards compatibility: it will break compatibility. But codes using this feature will be pretty easy to adapt the new interface.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Implementation\r\n\r\nAre you willing to implement this feature?: Yes",
