  "body": "I was trying to Mine some Görli Testnet. It's been almost a week and i can't mine and sync the node. First I was syncing the node on CPU with CPU mining. The node synced completely after 3 days and eth.syncing was returning false. That means that my node is not syncing more or completely synced but then I realized that node is taking too much storage(One issue). The command I was using is\r\n\r\nGeth --goerli --datadir \"E:\"\r\n\r\nAfter syncing of complete node I start mining using,\r\n\r\ngeth attach ipc://./pipe/geth.ipc personal.newAccount() miner.setEtherbase(eth.accounts[0]) miner.start(8)\r\n\r\nand it returns that Mining is aborted due to unsync. and eth.hashrate = 0 always. Then i used ubuntu on Aws server to save my Time and storage. I started to sync the node but getting error, showing me always \"connecting to Peers\" and this error,\r\n\r\nSnapshot extension registration failed peer=0a807721 err=\"peer connected on snap without compatible eth support\".\r\n\r\nI am using this command: geth --goerli --datadir Ethereum/ --port=30303 --syncmode full --http --http.addr 'localhost' --http.port 8501 --http.api 'personal,db,eth,net,web3,txpool,miner' --networkid 5 --miner.gasprice '0' -unlock '0x98d692FB78583c4936B8CE7eF4F332191195B5FA' --password Ethereum/password.txt --mine --allow-insecure-unlock\r\n\r\nGeth Version: 1.10.21-stable Git Commit: 671094279e8d27f4b4c3c94bf8b636c26b473976 Git Commit Date: 20220727 Architecture: amd64 Go Version: go1.18.4 Operating System: windows GOPATH= GOROOT=go Ubuntu on Aws server\r\n\r\nNote: After starting the node on server i also tried to sync the node on my CPU. It is showing me the same error on my CPU and also on server.\r\n\r\nA little help would be appreciated. Thank you!\r\n![Screenshot (79)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/106604288/187373471-039c21e7-0d23-4280-bb72-580f3f9481de.png)\r\n",
