  "body": "#### System information\r\n\r\nGeth version: `1.10.22-unstable`\r\nOS & Version: `Ubuntu 20.04 LTS, 5.4.0-121-generic`\r\nCommit hash : `9d76a9b94f1d4f8b8a9c212151d96d6a13cb6ead`\r\n\r\nI am trying to migrate our datasource from openethereum to geth. For obtaining the same data, we want to use the tracer API of geth. When comparing data that we got from openethereum with geth, I can observe a very small discrepancy.\r\n\r\n#### Expected behaviour\r\nIn instances where `CREATE2` frames error out because the execution went out of gas, this seems not to be accurately depicted by geth. According to geth, the frame in which the \"out of gas\" occurs is the top level call frame, rather than the `CREATE2` frame (which is missing in the result entirely).\r\n\r\nUsing the example below, I would expect the result to look similar to this:\r\n\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  \"result\": {\r\n    \"type\": \"CALL\",\r\n    \"from\": \"0xb59bff945a74a427c74fb27ae423fcf81da27c24\",\r\n    \"to\": \"0xffa397285ce46fb78c588a9e993286aac68c37cd\",\r\n    \"value\": \"0x0\",\r\n    \"gas\": \"0x267a6\",\r\n    \"gasUsed\": \"0x267a6\",\r\n    \"input\": \"0xfb90b320000000000000000000000000c9b0576f11635e88cc040ebf13ef57f326f553110000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000183\",\r\n    \"error\": \"out of gas\",\r\n    \"calls\":[{\r\n      \"type\": \"CREATE2\",\r\n      \"from\": \"0xffa397285ce46fb78c588a9e993286aac68c37cd\",\r\n      \"value\": \"0x0\",\r\n      \"input\": \"0x3d602d80600a3d3981f3363d3d373d3d3d363d73059ffafdc6ef594230de44f824e2bd0a51ca5ded5af43d82803e903d91602b57fd5bf3\",\r\n      \"gas\": \"0x1d8a7\",\r\n      \"gasUsed\": \"0x1d8a7\",\r\n      \"error\": \"out of gas\"\r\n    }]\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Actual behaviour\r\nIn the block range from 14992579 to 14999613 I was able to find seven such instances, all of them involving `CREATE2` and `out of gas`:\r\n\r\n| block    | tx  |\r\n|----------|-----|\r\n| 14992579 | 70  |\r\n| 14993975 | 100 |\r\n| 14993997 | 90  |\r\n| 14997259 | 62  |\r\n| 14997534 | 128 |\r\n| 14999176 | 209 |\r\n| 14999613 | 271 |\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Steps to reproduce the behaviour\r\n- `nc -U geth.ipc`\r\n- example with the first entry in the table above: `{\"jsonrpc\": \"2.0\", \"id\": 1, \"method\": \"debug_subscribe\", \"params\": [\"traceChain\", \"0xe4c4c2\", \"0xe4c4c3\", {\"tracer\": \"callTracer\", \"reexec\": 2500000}]}`\r\n- the full result can be viewed [here](https://pastebin.com/3Gdf4NW0), but the relevant part can be navigated to like this:\r\n  - `res['params']['result']['traces'][70]`, which in this case gives:\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  \"result\": {\r\n    \"type\": \"CALL\",\r\n    \"from\": \"0xb59bff945a74a427c74fb27ae423fcf81da27c24\",\r\n    \"to\": \"0xffa397285ce46fb78c588a9e993286aac68c37cd\",\r\n    \"value\": \"0x0\",\r\n    \"gas\": \"0x267a6\",\r\n    \"gasUsed\": \"0x267a6\",\r\n    \"input\": \"0xfb90b320000000000000000000000000c9b0576f11635e88cc040ebf13ef57f326f553110000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000183\",\r\n    \"error\": \"out of gas\"\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nLet me know if there's anything else I can do to help recreate this problem.",

    "body": "Interesting. Just to make things clear, there are several things which could be going on here, so let's first define them. \r\n\r\n1. The `CREATE2` call goes OOG. The `CREATE2` opcode costs `32000` gas up front, plus a dynamic part depending on 1) the memory expansion and 2) the size of the initcode. This is still in the outer context.  \r\n2. The `CREATE2` starts executing the `initcode`, but goes OOG while this is executing. \r\n3. The `initcode` executes fine, but the returned `runtime_bytecode` cannot be stored on-chain, because the dynamic cost of `len(code) * params.CreateDataGas (200)` causes OOG. \r\n\r\nIMO the best thing to do would be to make some pretty simple testcases of these three cases, and take it from there. I can look into it at some point, but it will probably take a few weeks.\r\n\r\nCase 1 is definitely in the outer context, case 2 is definitely in the inner context. Case 3 is not as clear-cut IMO.",
