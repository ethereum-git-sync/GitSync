This is meant to be the same when actually mining too.\n#### Actual behaviour\n\nWhen actually mining, I get 4-5MH/s. Rolling back the drivers is NOT an option since they don't support the 980 TI thus a better fix must be found.\n#### Steps to reproduce the behaviour\n\nWindows 10 64bit with up to date drivers for NVIDIA.\n#### Backtrace\n\n```\n[backtrace]\n```\n",
