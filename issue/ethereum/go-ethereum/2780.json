  "body": "Reasons:\n- GPU mining needs OpenCL libraries, so it requires custom local builds and isn't portable.\n- Mining in general is more suited to C++, where it's also arguable easier (Geth + ethminer).\n- There's already a semi-established project for mining https://github.com/Genoil/cpp-ethereum.\n- Private networks can be run on CPU mining, no need for the GPU complexity and mess.\n- There's no one to maintain the OpenCL miner so if anything breaks, it's a waste to fix it.\n- The OpenCL dependency makes a mess of the Go vendoring as it adds weird build tags.\n",
