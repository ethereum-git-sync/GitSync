Anything else is the \"tyranny of the default\".\n\nIf you can not be bothered do that, can you at least properly document it? It is not even in the --help command and it should be in bold at the top of the README after release.\n\nI will assume it was an oversight that this was not included but it should obviously be included and properly documented in the README while the decisions are being made. \n\nYou may find it hard to believe but some of us actually want a platform to run unstoppable applications and it seems the organization that raised funds under this premise is now doing their best to make this hard as possible. \n",
