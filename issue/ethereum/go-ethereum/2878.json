  "body": "I have an account that I want to sweep. I want to sweep to a funds splitting contract (ETC/ETH). I'm only interested in sweeping the ETH balance and my goal is for the account to end up with a balance of _zero_ (e.g. no dust).\n\nThis is the fund splitting contract I'm trying to use: [0x1e143b2588705dfea63a17f2032ca123df995ce0](http://etherscan.io/address/0x1e143b2588705dfea63a17f2032ca123df995ce0#code)\n\nIt seems as if the gas required for this operation is 29,717. For example, here is a sample transaction I sent to the contract, which according to etherscan.io required that amount of gas: [0x7cd52325c0945d0de975a6713abdc50659c0c62ef523a1a99f2ad2a2d4128a8f](http://etherscan.io/tx/0x7cd52325c0945d0de975a6713abdc50659c0c62ef523a1a99f2ad2a2d4128a8f)\n\nHowever, if I send a transaction and limit the amount of gas to 29,717, my transaction fails. For example, here is a sample transaction I sent to the contract with a gas limit of 29,717, which failed: [0xcd31481b4dd9410daa22c8a47f9a4b29ef4a305877174eb346433bb4e6b03089](http://etherscan.io/tx/0xcd31481b4dd9410daa22c8a47f9a4b29ef4a305877174eb346433bb4e6b03089)\n\nI discovered the minimum amount of gas that I need to specify for one of these transfers to work is 31,991.\nTransaction with 31,991 gas which worked: [0x7cd52325c0945d0de975a6713abdc50659c0c62ef523a1a99f2ad2a2d4128a8f](http://etherscan.io/tx/0x7cd52325c0945d0de975a6713abdc50659c0c62ef523a1a99f2ad2a2d4128a8f)\nTransaction with 31,990 gas which failed: [0x8c92fde3cf07b3cdbf4dcc54ed6ccfb072f22933ab556612f3d23317a2466280](http://etherscan.io/tx/0x8c92fde3cf07b3cdbf4dcc54ed6ccfb072f22933ab556612f3d23317a2466280)\n\nHowever, when the tx goes through, it seems as if it only used 29,717 gas. For example:\nAccount [0x19d90f1106c600bd8a70b5775776b4ecdc7a945b](http://etherscan.io/address/0x19d90f1106c600bd8a70b5775776b4ecdc7a945b) had a balance of `0.01282711 ETH` (at block `1964300`).\n\nI sent transaction [0xb57c8b5aede3070e2fb80ea9a21ec43293cb5c7392ccb36357388422e9055509](http://etherscan.io/tx/0xb57c8b5aede3070e2fb80ea9a21ec43293cb5c7392ccb36357388422e9055509) with the following details:\n- Value: `0.01218729 ETH`\n- Gas: `31991`\n- Gas Price: `20000000000 Wei`\n\nSo:\n- Balance before TX: `0.01282711 ETH`\n- Amount to send: `0.01218729 ETH`\n- Supposed cost of TX: `Gas` \\* `Price` = `0.00063982 ETH`\n- Balance - Amount to send - Supposed cost of TX = _ZERO!_\n\nHowever, as you can see, account [0x19d90f1106c600bd8a70b5775776b4ecdc7a945b](http://etherscan.io/address/0x19d90f1106c600bd8a70b5775776b4ecdc7a945b) has a balance of `0.00004548 ETH`, meaning the cost of the TX was actually `0.00059434 ETH`, which at a gas price of `20000000000 Wei`, would mean the gas used was: `29717` (which we already knew of course)!\n\nSo the question is:\n- Why are the transactions which specify a gas limit of `29717` failing?\n#### System information\n\nGeth version: 1.4.10-stable-c2eea630\nOS & Version: Linux\n#### Expected behaviour\n\nTransaction 0x19d90f1106c600bd8a70b5775776b4ecdc7a945b should've been successful.\n#### Actual behaviour\n\nTransaction 0x19d90f1106c600bd8a70b5775776b4ecdc7a945b failed due to lack of gas.\n#### Steps to reproduce the behaviour\n\nUse the `transfer(address)` function of contract `0x1e143b2588705dfea63a17f2032ca123df995ce0` by sending some amount and limit the amount of gas to `29717`\n#### Backtrace\n\n```\n[backtrace]\n```\n",

The sending account needs to have funds for this stipend but it doesn't use all 2300 of it. This means you need to have more funds available than what you will end up paying for gas. The end result is that you cannot sweep the whole balance of an account into this contract.\n\nA possible way would be to design the contract in a way that it consumes the full 2300 gas of the gas stipend with some unnecessary commands, but that's of course inefficient. \n",

    "body": "There could be other more exotic use cases too. For example if a contract behaves differently based on how much gas it's given, it may actually be impossible to make a meaningful gas estimation as it may run on a completely different code path.\n\nSo in general, sweeping from/to contracts may not be so obvious or even possible depending on their implementation :)\n",
