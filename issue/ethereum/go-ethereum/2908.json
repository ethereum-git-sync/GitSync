  "body": "**I thought I should edit to include an update right at the top of the body: three of the four Geth accounts have been unlocked thanks to @DcyMatrix's suggestion below**\n\nRequesting advice/help in solving this problem:\n\nI created four Geth accounts in late May, and gave each a different password, which I carefully noted down (I wrote the passwords down on paper, then I entered them into the Geth command line).\n\nYesterday I tried to unlock the accounts, and none of the passwords worked, for any of the accounts. I'm transcribing the passwords from the same piece of paper that I initially read from when entering them into the Geth client, so it's very unlikely that this was an input error.\n\nI've searched the internet and found these four links where people report having similar problems:\n\nMist Wallet password problem - https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/4na19x/mist_wallet_password_problem/\n\nMist Wallet says wrong password, be careful - https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/4jzxft/mist_wallet_says_wrong_password_be_careful/\n\nMist password wrong error 0.7.6 - https://github.com/ethereum/mist/issues/923\n\nPassword Assistance Needed :) - https://forum.ethereum.org/discussion/8422/password-assistance-needed\n\nA common factor in all of these is accounts being created in May, so it may have something to do with a version of Geth that was in wide use in May. \n\nSomeone in the discussion linked by the second URL from the top mentioned fixing their problem with Jaxx Kryptokit. I tried importing one of the accounts into the Jaxx Kryptokit wallet:\n\nhttps://ethereumwallet.com/beta/index.html#dYb9\n\nand put in the password, and it did not work, so I do believe that the password is wrong.\n\nI found this bug report relating to both Mist and Geth: \n\nhttps://github.com/ethereum/mist/issues/182#issuecomment-198908871\n\nI'm wondering if this could be related.\n\nI created two new accounts today with two new passwords, and was able to unlock both with their passwords, but I did that with Geth 1.5.0-unstable and the version I was running in late May was different. \n\nIf I lose this ETH this would set me back a few years, so I'm very anxious right now. Any help would be appreciated.\n\nEdit, more details:\n\nI was running Geth 1.5.0 unstable, with this snapshot: 1.5.0+986SNAPSHOT20160511110231trusty-0ubuntu1 \n\nSo this is the snapshot as of May 11th 2016\n",

Mist has(had?) a bug where any send error would output the 'wrong password' message, so there's a possibility that your transaction was failing for other reasons, and it was incorrectly reporting to you the cause as a 'wrong password'. It's a long shot, but you need to eliminate all of the long shot possibilities.\n\n@DavidMc0 thanks! \n",

It won't even accept a Paste of an Ether address so I have to type in everything. I'm unable to Paste. \n\nAs mentioned, I've been dealing with this for over a month as my Issue has now basically gone cold with no further user advice so this thread is breathing new hope for me. \n",
