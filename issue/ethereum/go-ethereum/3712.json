The first step consists of support for the *Ledger Nano S* and *Ledger Blue (USB only)* HD hardware wallets (https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/3592), also laying the groundwork for supporting subsequent hardware and software HD wallets.\\r\\n\\r\\nOther notable changes:\\r\\n\\r\\n * Genesis JSON additions and polishes for black box testing https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/3635, https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/3656\\r\\n * Split off Android builds into Linux build jobs https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/3662\\r\\n * Swarm manifest manipulation commands https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/3645\\r\\n * Slim down versioned Alpine Docker images https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/3670\\r\\n\\r\\nBugfixes:\\r\\n\\r\\n * Fix data race in transaction pool nonce retrieval https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/3625\\r\\n * Support swarm in-process restarts https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/3651\\r\\n * Fix `abigen` contract parsing for `solc` v1.4.8+ https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/3648\\r\\n * Fix shutdown issue for swarm running in a docker container https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/3649\\r\\n\\r\\nFor a full rundown, please see the [v1.5.9 milestone](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/milestone/46?closed=1).\\r\\n\\r\\n**Binaries and mobile libraries are available on our [download page](https://geth.ethereum.org/downloads/)**.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Ledger ProTips\\r\\n\\r\\n * Signing EIP155 transactions requires at least v1.0.3 of the Ethereum app on the Ledger.\\r\\n   * You may sign non-EIP155 transactions using the `go-ethereum` library directly.\\r\\n * Contract interactions or deploys need to enable `Contract data` from the Ethereum app `Settings`.\\r\\n * `Browser support` needs to be turned off from the Ethereum app `Settings` (different protocol).\\r\\n * Windows support requires a USB driver (official Red Hat): https://github.com/daynix/UsbDk/releases\\r\\n    * May be bundled into our installer later, we're curious how well it holds up in the wild first.\\r\\n * Linux support might require [granting the user write access](http://support.ledgerwallet.com/knowledge_base/topics/ledger-wallet-is-not-recognized-on-linux) to the Ledger \\r\\n * Accounts are automatically derived, searching for non zero balance or non zero nonce.\\r\\n    * First empty account is always listed (sending it funds will derive the next empty account).\\r\\n * Mist doesn't know about Ledger, if asked for a password, enter empty and confirm tx on device.\\r\\n * If in doubt, unplug and replug :P \\r\\n\\r\\n### Go API changes\\r\\n\\r\\n*Just to emphasize, the section below is about the Go API (i.e. `go-ethereum` library) changes. The RPC did not incur any backwards incompatible changes. If you do find something, it's a bug, please report it.*\\r\\n\\r\\nUntil now the `go-ethereum` codebase assumed that accounts are equivalent to individual private keys stored on disk inside a keystore. To support hardware and HD wallets however, this invariant breaks, requiring a new API with different constructs and mechanisms. We've tried our best to introduce this new API in such a way that it's trivial to transition to it for anyone already using `go-ethereum` as a library from Go or Java/ObjC/Swift.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first breaking change is that while previously the `accounts.Manager` (or `AccountManager` on mobile) was a glorified keystore, now it changed its scope to handle `Wallet` objects, which may contain multiple accounts, as well as may be backed by different backends (keystore or hardware). The previous keystore is kept intact, just renamed to `Keystore` within the `keystore` package (arguably a better name and location). If you used the account manager in your own code, a simple swap to the keystore should more or less just work™.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe other breaking change you need to be aware of is that while previously transaction signing in the keystore only required a hash of the transaction, the new code requires the entire transaction object. This is needed to support hardware wallets which require the transaction details for user confirmation UI elements.\"\r\n}\r\n```",

The release also contains a few developer niceties. **Please see compatibility section below!**\\r\\n\\r\\n**New features:**\\r\\n\\r\\n * Roll out v2 of the `les` light client protocol (https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/14970, https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/15367, https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/15391).\\r\\n * Insta-mining, zero CPU, clique based PoA developer mode `--dev` (https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/15323).\\r\\n * Add API endpoint to list modified accounts between two blocks (https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/15512).\\r\\n * Gas estimation returns error instead of maxgas if transaction cannot be executed (https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/15477).\\r\\n * Improve EVM jump destination analysis for worst case scenarios (https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/14582).\\r\\n * Enforce `application/json` for HTTP RPC requests (https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/15220, https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/15496).\\r\\n * Private network faucet support Facebook, Twitter and Google+ authentication (https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/15313).\\r\\n * Support encrypted SSH keys in the Puppeth network manager (https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/15443).\\r\\n * Introduce docker images containing all Ethereum tools (https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/15467).\\r\\n * Start shipping Ubuntu Artful Aardvark launchpad packages (https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/15344).\\r\\n\\r\\n**Squashed bugs:**\\r\\n\\r\\n * Fix log filtering when specifying non-8-multiple starting block number (https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/15489).\\r\\n * Fix replacement transaction propagation (https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/15343).\\r\\n * Reduce disk overhead on keystore startup (https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/15526, https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/15527, https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/15529).\\r\\n * Fix occasional Rinkeby chain split by additional fork selection logic (https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/15470).\\r\\n * Fix JavaScript tracing to permit working with `Address` types (https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/15297).\\r\\n * Fix missing commit hash in docker image versions (https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/15458, https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/15464).\\r\\n\\r\\n**Compatibility caveats:**\\r\\n\\r\\n * All HTTP RPC requests from now on need to have the `Content-Type: application/json` header set on them. Geth v1.7.3 will **refuse** to service requests with no content type headers set (or headers with different content types). This is a security measure to counter a browser CORS circumvention technique.\\r\\n * Geth v1.7.3 ships with `les/2` light client support, which might have harder time finding light servers initially until the server providers upgrade to v1.7.3 too.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor a full rundown of changes, please see the [v1.7.3](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/milestone/59?closed=1) milestone.\\r\\n\\r\\n**As always, binaries and mobile libraries are available on our [download page](https://geth.ethereum.org/downloads/)**.\"\r\n}",
