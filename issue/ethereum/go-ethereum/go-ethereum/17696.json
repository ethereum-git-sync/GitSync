We're removing account management from `geth` and moving it into `clef`, which is a standalone binary solely for account/key management. \r\n- The user interaction flow with 'clef' is a sign-what-you-see. Before actual code is written, I'd like to figure out a couple of things. \r\n   - Like, what is the exact proposed API format\r\n   - How can the user verify what he is signing? \r\n\r\nI'm thinking that maybe the signer can, for now, only deal with certain subs of EIP-191, the first two being `0x45` and `0x01`. \r\n\r\n\r\nThis also ties in with some other work I'm doing for clef, namely the ability to sign Clique headers. One thing I'm pondering is to have `accounts_sign(content_type, ... )`, where content-type can be e.g `application/clique` or `application/eip191` etc. ",

    "body": "Okay so I had a thorough read on both the EIP-191 and EIP-712 specs, their adjacent[[1](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/issues/2940)][[2](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/issues/14794)] links and your Clique WIP and I confirm I am able to take on both tasks.\r\n\r\nThanks for the brief intro to `clef` and for the `accounts_sign` suggestion. Just to confirm, you're referring to having the following list of `content-type`:\r\n\r\n• `application/clique`\r\n• `application/eip191`\r\n• `application/eip712`\r\n\r\nWhere `eip191` maps to the `0x00` and `0x45` version bytes and `eip712` to `0x01`?\r\n\r\nRe coordination - totally agree, the UX can be really easily a nightmare for the non-technical end user, thus I'd suggest, for now, asking wallets to only accept JSON compatible data which can be nicely presented just like [here](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/assets/eip-712/eth_signTypedData.png?raw=true). Non-JSON could still be accepted, but with a warning saying \"Your data is not JSON compatible. You can still sign it, but please be careful and double check\". Furthermore, I see a potential cross over with ENS to make accounts look more human-readable.\r\n\r\nAlso, is there any Slack or Riot room focused specifically on geth and sigs? I think it'd be helpful to hang around there to keep discussions as lightweight as possible. I'll also try to DYOR as much as I can to avoid unnecessary questions.",

    "body": "> Currently, Ethereum signatures are sorta bad \r\n\r\nTotally agree. Bad bordering useless. \r\n\r\nIt's great that you're jumping in, because I don't want to end up building an API endpoint that does not fit the usecase it's intended for, so it would be good to have some more info on e.g. how you would like to call it. While 712 has an example, the 191 spec (which I'm a co-author of) doesn't currently have any examples on the API-side for how the corresponding signing methods should look. I'm thinking that a starting point would be to implement `191/172` but return errors for other 191 subtypes (until those get specced and implemented)\r\n\r\nAnd btw: `unlock` is being nuked from orbit, but a semi-advanced user will be able to set rules allowing certain types of operation automatically, such as e..g signing a certain type of data.

Doing a lot of research across many ethereum repos now.\r\n\r\nI have a few other quick questions, but I'll defer them to Discord to keep this thread only for significant updates. Thank you @holiman @tuxxy @ceresstation!",

    "body": "Hey there, a fresh update, I created a small repo documenting my latest research: https://github.com/PaulRBerg/ethereum-signatures-progress\r\n\r\nThere's a list of resources and projects which have already tinkered with EIP-191 and EIP-712. Thanks to @cooganb for reaching out on Discord to mention their [work](https://github.com/HatchCrypto/unilogin) on a basic login system adhering to 191. \r\n\r\nI'll constantly update the registries in there as there is significant progress. As `geth` itself is concerned, I delved into its meat, playing around and analysing `clef`, `rpc` and `signer`. Strategy:\r\n\r\n1.  Continue familiarising with the submodules above, specifically with `signer` as that's where the standards should be coded in\r\n2. As 191 is kinda encompassing 712, I'll first focus on a few commits for a minimum viable 191 which implements `0x45` and returns a hardcoded message for `0x01`. Will iterate fast and continue from there.\r\n\r\nJust to confirm, the signing methods should be available both in `clef` in the CLI and in RPC via `clef_signTypedData`? Or, for the JSON-RPC, is it that other prefix should be used (`clef` is not currently listed in the [wiki](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/wiki/Management-APIs))?\r\n\r\nUPDATE: no answer needed anymore. I sorted it out, clef is using the `account` prefix as per the [README](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/tree/master/cmd/clef#methods).",

    "body": "Hi there, I participated at EthSF, but still worked on these EIPs on the side. Currently tweaking the `rpc/http` and `rpc/server` code to make it work with the arbitrary key values required by EIP-712. You can find my latest work at https://github.com/PaulRBerg/go-ethereum/tree/eip191/712_wip\r\n\r\nThe problem specifically is that the geth rpc server should accept a new struct called `TypedData` but it returns empty maps: `map[] map[] map[]` when querying `eth_signStructuredData`. Here's the struct definition, POST data and response:\r\n\r\n```go\r\ntype TypedData struct {\r\n\tTypes \t\tmap[string] interface{}\t\t`json:\"types\"`\r\n\tPrimaryType\tstring\t\t\t\t`json:\"primaryType\"`\r\n\tDomain \t\tmap[string] interface{}\t\t`json:\"domain\"`\r\n\tMessage \tmap[string]\tinterface{}\t`json:\"message\"`\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  \"jsonrpc\": \"2.0\",\r\n  \"method\": \"account_signStructuredData\",\r\n  \"params\": [\r\n    \"0xCD2a3d9F938E13CD947Ec05AbC7FE734Df8DD826\",\r\n    {\r\n      \"types\": {\r\n        \"EIP712Domain\": [\r\n          {\r\n            \"name\": \"name\",\r\n            \"type\": \"string\"\r\n          },\r\n          {\r\n            \"name\": \"version\",\r\n            \"type\": \"string\"\r\n          },\r\n          {\r\n            \"name\": \"chainId\",\r\n            \"type\": \"uint256\"\r\n          },\r\n          {\r\n            \"name\": \"verifyingContract\",\r\n            \"type\": \"address\"\r\n          }\r\n        ],\r\n        \"Person\": [\r\n          {\r\n            \"name\": \"name\",\r\n            \"type\": \"string\"\r\n          },\r\n          {\r\n            \"name\": \"wallet\",\r\n            \"type\": \"address\"\r\n          }\r\n        ],\r\n        \"Mail\": [\r\n          {\r\n            \"name\": \"from\",\r\n            \"type\": \"Person\"\r\n          },\r\n          {\r\n            \"name\": \"to\",\r\n            \"type\": \"Person\"\r\n          },\r\n          {\r\n            \"name\": \"contents\",\r\n            \"type\": \"string\"\r\n          }\r\n        ]\r\n      },\r\n      \"primaryType\": \"Mail\",\r\n      \"domain\": {\r\n        \"name\": \"Ether Mail\",\r\n        \"version\": \"1\",\r\n        \"chainId\": 1,\r\n        \"verifyingContract\": \"0xCcCCccccCCCCcCCCCCCcCcCccCcCCCcCcccccccC\"\r\n      },\r\n      \"message\": {\r\n        \"from\": {\r\n          \"name\": \"Cow\",\r\n          \"wallet\": \"0xCD2a3d9F938E13CD947Ec05AbC7FE734Df8DD826\"\r\n        },\r\n        \"to\": {\r\n          \"name\": \"Bob\",\r\n          \"wallet\": \"0xbBbBBBBbbBBBbbbBbbBbbbbBBbBbbbbBbBbbBBbB\"\r\n        },\r\n        \"contents\": \"Hello, Bob!\"\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n  ],\r\n  \"id\": 1\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n```go\r\nfmt.Println(\"data\", data)\r\n// output after RPC call is `data {map[]  map[] map[]}`\r\n```\r\n\r\nSpecifically, I'm trying to make it work as explained in this StackOverflow [thread](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9801312/golang-nested-properties-for-structs-with-unknown-property-names). Someone pointed me that [eth_getLogs](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/JSON-RPC#eth_getlogs) is similar, will check that out.\r\n\r\n### UPDATE\r\nI tried only with a basic struct and it still doesn't parse it correctly:\r\n\r\n```go\r\ntype TypedData struct {\r\n\tPrimaryType string `json:\"primaryType\"`\r\n} \r\n```\r\n\r\n```go\r\nfmt.Println(\"data.PrimaryType\", data.PrimaryType)\r\n// output after RPC call is `data.PrimaryType`\r\n```\r\n\r\nCurrently investigating how `crit FilterCriteria` is parsed in `func (api *PublicFilterAPI) GetLogs(ctx context.Context, crit FilterCriteria) ([]*types.Log, error)` in `eth/filters/api.go`. There must be some fundamental differences in the core codecs used.\r\n\r\n### UPDATE 2 \r\n\r\nFigured it out by reading lines 274-276 from `eth/filters/api.go`:\r\n\r\n```\r\n// FilterCriteria represents a request to create a new filter.\r\n// Same as ethereum.FilterQuery but with UnmarshalJSON() method.\r\ntype FilterCriteria ethereum.FilterQuery\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow writing the custom UnmarshalJSON() function for `TypedData`.",
