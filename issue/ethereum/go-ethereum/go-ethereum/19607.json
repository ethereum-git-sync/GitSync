    "body": "There are a few interesting corner cases here that we'd need to consider:\r\n\r\n * If you create a subscription to pending transactions, I guess that would be streaming individual transactions back to you. However, the pending block is continually assembled as transactions come, until it's full, so you won't know when a transaction belongs to a previous or next block. Should we also add inclusion block numbers?\r\n * Some nodes (miners) may periodically (every 3 second) reconstruct blocks to better optimize gas earnings, what happens if the same pending block gets a new set of transactions, what should be streamed.\r\n * The pending block is just a guess as to what transactions might be included in the next 15 seconds. Is that really so valuable? The transactions might disappear, they might get delayed arbitrarilly many blocks, and pending transactions might not even show up in the pendig block if they don't fit yet (e.g. if there are 1000  txs in the pool, but only 200 fits).\r\n * If you want to detect received funds, you might run into interesting issues with contract senders, where the transaction recipient is actually a multi-sig that forwards funds to you. You have no way to detect that unless you have a contract account firing logs, in which case I think you can already subscribe to pending logs.",
