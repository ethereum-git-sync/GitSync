    "body": "`GasPrice` is in [Wei](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/White-Paper#currency-and-issuance), which is the smallest unit of the Ether. Like it is not possible to pay less than a cent, it is not possible to handle less than a Wei.\r\n\r\nThe problem you are running into is that the gas price is coded as an integer, which is the correct behavior. When you try to pass a decimal number, it will fail. `-1` is recognized as an integer, but the sanitization code will not accept a value lower than 1, and uses the default value of `1000000000` instead.\r\n\r\nSo I'll be closing this issue, setting `GasPrice` to 1 does exactly what you want.",
