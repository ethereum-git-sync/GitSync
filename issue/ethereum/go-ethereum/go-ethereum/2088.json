  "body": "I want to calculate the total supply.   But I cannot.\n\n---\n\nI am wondering if I understand the mining rewards correctly. \nI think it is **not** simply \n\n```\nsupply = premine + blocknumber*blockreward\n```\n\nbecause of \"uncles\", right?\n\nAn _uncle miner_ gets 4.375 coins or 3.75 coins (for 0Uncles and 1Uncles).   Correct? More such additional rewards?\n\nPlus _including_ an uncle _into a block_ gives an extra 5/32 coins to the _block miner_. Correct?\n\n---\n\nSo the total supply of ETH is (probably)\n\n```\nsupply = premine \n+ blockReward * eth.blockNumber \n+ 0UncleReward * eth.numberOf0Uncles \n+ 1UncleReward * eth.numberOf1Uncles \n+ includeUnclesReward * NumberOfIncludedUncles\n```\n\n**Correct, or am I completely missing the point?**\n\nEDIT: As far as I understand it, this should be true\n\n```\nNumberOfIncludedUncles = eth.numberOf0Uncles + eth.numberOf1Uncles \nblockReward = 5\n0UncleReward = 4.375\n1UncleReward = 3.75\nincludeUnclesReward = 5/32\n```\n\nso the only new thing a future version needs to provide are these two integers\n\n```\neth.numberOf0Uncles\neth.numberOf1Uncles \n```\n\n---\n\n**If** the above is (near to) correct ... then it is impossible to calculate the REAL current supply at the moment. So: \n\n**I suggest new API functions:**\n\n```\neth.getUncleCount(fromBlock,toBlock)\n```\n\nor at least the aggregate sums until the current block:\n\n```\neth.numberOf0Uncles\neth.numberOf1Uncles \n```\n\nwhere the first one would return the tuple of number of 0Uncles and 1Uncles (and 2Uncles if there are any) in that range of blocks; or the second one would return simple integers with the total number of {0,1}-uncles from genesis until now (similar to the eth.blockNumber integer).\n\n---\n\nOr is there an easier way to do this?\n\nUsed sources:\n- https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/issues/1591#issuecomment-128049106\n- http://gavwood.com/paper.pdf equation 143 & 144\n- https://forum.ethereum.org/discussion/2437/confused-about-block-rewards\n\nP.S.: Even the \"big guys\" are of a differing opinion on the \"supply\" topic - there is a (0.3 percent) difference between the \"supply\" reported at etherscan and CMC. Is that because of the above ?\n",
