Peer does something stupid, I call drop peer. Before the drop proceeds, peer disconnects and reconnects.\r\nDrop gets sheduled after a reconnect, since it's the same peer id, the peer gets nuked off again or similar weird races.\r\n\r\n### Solution\r\nI think in general this was a wrong design to address/drop/whatnot peers by id instead of passing around the actual reference to them.\r\n",
