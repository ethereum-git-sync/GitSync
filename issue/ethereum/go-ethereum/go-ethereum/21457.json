  "body": "Hi there,\r\n\r\nThis is to continue the discussion in the following thread: https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/issues/20212. The original thread proposed moving ethapi out of internal but was closed as the problem was solved a different way.\r\n\r\nThere's another good reason to consider moving ethapi out of internal:\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nI'm trying to use `go-ethereum`'s RPC API over a simulated back-end object as a library. I'm using a simulated back-end for smart contracts from another programming language and would like to have some fallback access to the simulated back-end state through the RPC API rather than having to implement each end-point one by one.\r\n\r\nIn order to set up the RPC API I'm using `NewServer()` and using a bi-directional pipe as the `codec`. The place where this approach fails is that `APIs()` are only available to full or light ethereum clients, but not the simulated back-end. The simulated back-end exposes `GetAPIs()` but this function is only available as part of `internal/ethapi`.\r\n\r\nAs a result I'm trying to effectively copy & paste the whole `internal/api` folder in my codebase but running into another related [issue](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/issues/20226) that I've filed.\r\n\r\nWould love to also hear your guidance on how to achieve this and hope this helps support the overall thinking around the `ethapi`!\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n**To summarize - from my perspective there should be a way to use `APIs` or `GetAPIs` with the simulated back-end, I wouldn't actually need the whole `ethapi` package to be exposed.**\r\n",

    "body": "I spent some time thinking about this issue, but I don't think that we should implement it. The SimulatedBackend should imo only be used from go code and I don't think setting up a RPC API on it should be a priority. The sim backend is mainly useful for unit testing in go, for other use cases the `--dev` mode of ethereum is better suited. \r\n\r\nFor the simulated backend to be able to provide all necessary functions to create a meaningful RPC API, it needs to implement the `ethapi.Backend` interface https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/blob/45cb1a580abad0d4e8caa1c8b7dfacd5ef3d27bc/internal/ethapi/backend.go#L41. This would mean adding a lot more functionality into it, that is not needed by most users, so I would prefer not to do it. \r\n\r\n",

    "body": "Plus one on this.\r\n\r\n> I spent some time thinking about this issue, but I don't think that we should implement it. The SimulatedBackend should imo only be used from go code and I don't think setting up a RPC API on it should be a priority. The sim backend is mainly useful for unit testing in go, for other use cases the `--dev` mode of ethereum is better suited.\r\n> \r\n> For the simulated backend to be able to provide all necessary functions to create a meaningful RPC API, it needs to implement the `ethapi.Backend` interface\r\n> \r\n> https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/blob/45cb1a580abad0d4e8caa1c8b7dfacd5ef3d27bc/internal/ethapi/backend.go#L41\r\n> \r\n> . This would mean adding a lot more functionality into it, that is not needed by most users, so I would prefer not to do it.\r\n\r\nI often run into a situation of wrapping eth client methods like so\r\n\r\n```go\r\nfunc WaitForTransactionConfirmed(ctxt context.Context, ethClient *ethclient.Client, txHash common.Hash) (bool, error)\r\n```\r\n\r\nwith no real way to unit test them without a `--dev` node. I could work on it depending on the scope. Not sure if things have changed drastically since you made this comment @MariusVanDerWijden\r\n",
