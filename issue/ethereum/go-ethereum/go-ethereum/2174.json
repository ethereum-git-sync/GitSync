  "body": "I am using Version: 1.4.0-unstable (installed yesterday) on Ubuntu 14.04.3 LTS on a large exoscale.ch cloud machine.\n\nSeveral times `miner.start(1)` is not responding, it is hard to reproduce but pops up regularly. Now it happened while geth was running (but not mining) and ssh crashed, I had to disconnect, just in case rebooted the machine. Then I started geth (as always) with `geth --genesis customGenesis.json --datadir dataDir --networkid 123 --nodiscover --maxpeers 0 --rpc --rpccorsdomain '*' --rpcaddr 0.0.0.0 --unlock 0x9b33ab4d5a2c575540dc667e28b3b9cb7a19ddc4 console` and then attempted to start mining (I know that exposing the rpc to the world is not a good idea, all for testing only)\n\n```\n> miner.start(1)\nI0205 10:18:49.925763 eth/backend.go:415] Automatic pregeneration of ethash DAG ON (ethash dir: /root/.ethash)\nI0205 10:18:49.925841 miner/miner.go:119] Starting mining operation (CPU=1 TOT=5)\nI0205 10:18:49.926492 eth/backend.go:422] checking DAG (ethash dir: /root/.ethash)\ntrue\n> I0205 10:18:49.931465 miner/worker.go:570] commit new work on block 209 with 0 txs & 0 uncles. Took 5.240275ms\nI0205 10:18:49.931640 ethash.go:220] Generating DAG for epoch 0 (size 1073739904) (0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000)\nI0205 10:18:51.686124 ethash.go:237] Done generating DAG for epoch 0, it took 1.754482029s\n```\n\nAt that point it was stuck forever. It was not just an output issue, the miner was really not running, CPU load was minimal and I see tx piling up in `web3.eth.pendingTransactions`. After a while I figured that when doing `miner.stop(1)` and `miner.start(1)` it would eventually start mining. Alternatively, it was not sufficient to delete the entire dataDir, I had to also delete the .ethash folder and then initialize the DAG again. Also note that I had set my etherbase, defaultAccount (both same) and the account was also unlocked. Maybe somebody could look into this. Thanks!\n",

    "body": "Wow, this is frustrating...for more than a year, i have tried installing private server on many platforms and the mining never ever has worked properly...yet it seems like others are able to make it work... whole articles are written on it.   what's the real story?  Am I missing something?\r\n\r\nSometimes it helps to delete and rebuild the ethash...sometimes not...usually if i delete the whole datadir, i can mine again for a few times, then back at the same lockup.  Does this stuff work at all?\r\n\r\nAm I just setting something wrong?  Or does nobody actually use this?\r\n\r\nmy current genesis.json:\r\n    \"config\": {\r\n        \"chainId\": 7,\r\n        \"homesteadBlock\": 0,\r\n        \"eip155Block\": 0,\r\n        \"eip158Block\": 0\r\n    },\r\n    \"nonce\": \"0x0000000000000442\",\r\n    \"timestamp\": \"0x00\",\r\n    \"parentHash\": \"0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000\",\r\n    \"extraData\": \"0x00\",\r\n    \"gasLimit\": \"0x8000000\",\r\n    \"difficulty\": \"0x01\",\r\n    \"mixhash\": \"0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000\",\r\n    \"coinbase\": \"0x5DFE021F45f00Ae83B0aA963bE44A1310a782fCC\",\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
