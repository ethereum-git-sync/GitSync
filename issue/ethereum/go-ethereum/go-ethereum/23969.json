  "body": "There is an atomic load inside the EVM loop that checks if execution should be terminated before reaching the end. The idea being that it’s nice if we can abort an infinite loop over rpc, after the rpc-call times out.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/blob/66ee9422f56626dccc94b00762b8991c9b3195b0/core/vm/interpreter.go#L183-L188\r\n\r\nCPU profile\r\n```\r\n         .          .    182:   steps := 0\r\n         .          .    183:   for {\r\n     120ms      120ms    184:           steps++\r\n     120ms      120ms    185:           if steps%1000 == 0 {\r\n         .          .    186:                   if atomic.LoadInt32(&in.evm.abort) != 0 {\r\n         .          .    187:                           break\r\n         .          .    188:                   }\r\n         .          .    189:           }\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe atomic itself is not a problem, but tracking steps is. This consumes at least one additional register.\r\n\r\nEasy quick improvements is to change the condition to `steps%1024`. https://godbolt.org/z/esfhf3EhW\r\n\r\nConsidering the feature is only to terminate long running looped EVM code, I propose to track jumps instead of steps. We can have `in.numJumps` field which will be bumped in `opJump()` and `opJumpi()`. And atomic flag will be checked every some number of jumps. The `numJumps` does not need to be ever reset if the condition is e.g. `numJumps % 64 == 0`. Also check what is the overhead of checking the atomic flag on every jump.",

Having long running branch-less code is restricted by the code size, but that doesn't yet apply to initcode.  Is that case however a strong enough argument to keep steps as opposed to jumps?",
