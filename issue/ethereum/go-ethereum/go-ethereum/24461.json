Opened here for discussion, to see if there's anything we can/should do to make this easier. \r\n\r\nSome data-providers would benefit from a scenarion like the following:\r\n\r\n1. Node `A` has (all) state for blocks `0-2M`, \r\n2. Node `B` has all state for blocks `2M-3M`,\r\n3. etc.. \r\nN. Node `N` has state from `13M` to `head`\r\n\r\nThis is _possible_, but would require a bit of coding, and some special setup. \r\n\r\nThe way to create a \"archive node from `1M to 2M`, currently, would be to: \r\n1. Use `syncmode=full` until 1M, \r\n2. Do a state-pruning\r\n   - After pruning, you can also copy the datadir for use with the `2M-3M` node, which needs to continue without `gcmode=archive` \r\n3. Use `syncmode=full gcmode=archive` between 1M and 2M\r\n4. Stop the node\r\n5. Run the node with `--nodiscover --maxpeers=0`. \r\n\r\nI guess the one thing lacking to script up such a scenario right now is that we don't have a way to stop at a certain block, e.g. `geth ...args.. --exit-at=2000000`.\r\n\r\nAnother useful option would be to extend `gcmode`, so that one could say e.g. `gcmode=0:full,1000000:archive,2000000:full`, meaning it would be given a set of `N:<mode>`, in increasing order, and automatically switch at the given numbers. \r\nI'll file this up as a potential feature.  \r\n\r\nA third way to achieve this would be to have the blocks in separate rlp dumps, and use the \r\n`geth import <0-1M> --gcmode=...; geth --snapshot prune ...; geth import  <1M-2M.rlp> --gcmode=archive ... `, \r\n\r\nThis third way does not require any new features, and it's pretty optimal from a network perspective, since it doesn't require any network IO. \r\n",

    "body": "It's an interesting idea. \r\n\r\nIn the approach you mentioned, it's still feasible to maintain a bunch of nodes for segmenting full archive states. And the biggest benefit is: we break this assumption that maintaining an archive node requires excellent hardware. And it's kind of\r\nscalable.\r\n\r\nAnd since we will switch to path-based scheme, so I am thinking how can we integrate your idea with this scheme. Under the new scheme, we will only maintain a single latest state with a bunch of reverse diffs. The state can be reverted via applying the reverse diffs. So these nodes can also stop at a specific height and keep all the reverse diffs. Then the entire reverse diff history is shared by a node set, and *state rewind cost* is kind of acceptable.",
