This is a known issue and we are working on a solution.\n\nReason why the disk is getting hammered is due to the random look ups that need to be done when reading blocks, state and other relevant information. \n\nThe `develop` branch already contains 1 part of the solution where keys of blocks are logically ordered by leveldb. The state trie key optimization is still being worked on by @karalabe. \n",
