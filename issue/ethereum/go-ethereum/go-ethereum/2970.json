  "body": "EVM CALL operations (with attached value transfers) work by charging the user for 9000 gas, out of which 2300 is allotted to the contract call and inherently returned back to the user if not fully consumed. This _stipend_ that's temporarily charged but returned is not accounted for by the gas estimation, causing an estimate that does not contain the full 9000 initial CALL cost, rather only the 6700 final one measured. This breaks the native bindings which do not currently provide estimate multipliers to cover unforeseen costs.\n\nThe similar issue is also present for manually specified gas allowances for CALLs, where the estimator has access only to the final gas consumed, not the intermediate one.\n\nTracking this stipend and gas allowance however is not obvious, because it may or may not be used up. And if multiple CALLs are executed then there can be heavy overlap between these gas values. The only clean way I can imagine is to rewrite the gas tracking to not only use a single value (`gasUsed`), but a tuple where the additional field would track the **maximum** that `gasUsed` ever was. This would handle both gas allowaces as well as stipends, because any temporary bump in the gasUsed value would be recorded if it goes above the previous max.\n",
