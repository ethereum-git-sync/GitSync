  "body": "I'm unsure if this is something I missed or is genuinely not there (maybe for a reason).\r\n\r\nYesterday I've tried to verify a contract on Etherscan, and unless it's a flat file (unlikely if you make anything remotely complex) you need to upload some insane amount of metadata. Something called the `Solidity input json`. It would be nice if Remix would dump this out too among the various resources it generates.\r\n\r\nI did see that there's an Etherscan Remix verification plugin that does generate it, but my key was rejected, so the only way I could verify is to hook into the HTTP traffic between the plugin and etherscan and extract the solidity-json-input from the browser request and submit it manually. I'm guessing there has to be an easier way.",
