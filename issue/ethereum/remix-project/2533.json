This creates a copy with a different name than the original (with \"Copy of\" prepended or \"copy\" appended, I forget)\r\n- right-click Rename it to restore the original name\r\n- right-click delete the original file.\r\n\r\nFour actions to do what one would normally do with a single drag-n-drop operation on a normal file explorer.\r\n",
