    "body": "I see now that this is essentially a duplicate of ethereum/remixd#8, and I’ve encountered the same issue: both my IDE (IntelliJ IDEA) and remix-ide autosave the file, leading to a conflict.\r\n\r\nIn order to get the workflow I (& @skilesare, @ajsantander) want\r\n\r\n* the dialog needs to be disabled (see [file-explorer.js](https://github.com/ethereum/remix-ide/blob/master/src/app/files/file-explorer.js#L35-L55)), and\r\n* remix-ide must be prevented from writing the file.\r\n\r\nI guess the latter could be achieved by either\r\n\r\n* disabling the [`sharedfolder` `set` function in remixd](https://github.com/ethereum/remixd/blob/master/src/services/sharedFolder.js#L72-L75),\r\n* disabling [`saveCurrentFile` in remix-ide](https://github.com/ethereum/remix-ide/blob/master/src/app/files/fileManager.js#L184-L197), or\r\n* disable the [5 second autosave trigger](https://github.com/ethereum/remix-ide/blob/master/src/app/editor/editor.js#L320-L327).\r\n\r\nAs a quick and dirty fix, I’ve disabled the `set` and the dialog.
