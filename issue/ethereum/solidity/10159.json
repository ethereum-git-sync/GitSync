I use fallback payable, but I need msg.data, so `receive()`(calls with no msg.data, but msg.value) should always fail if I didn't defined a `receive()` function \r\n\r\nThis warning is not fair: `Warning: This contract has a payable fallback function, but no receive ether function. Consider adding a receive ether function.`\r\n\r\nIf I add this receive function, that only reverts, than compiler will include it on the ABI of the contract. But this conflics with the warning and with https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/v0.7.4/security-considerations.html#take-warnings-seriously\r\n\r\nInstead, I added the first line of fallback as `require(msg.data.length > 0, \"bad call\")`.
