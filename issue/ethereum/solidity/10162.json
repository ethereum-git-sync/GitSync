    "body": "> Something else to consider is what would happen would array mutability inside of the loop block, in particular, whether the array's length can change. Some languages (C++) leave it up for the developer to not invalidate the iterators, while others (Rust) disallow this sort of mutation altogether.\r\n\r\nThat's not completely true. Rust does disallow that by default, but it's because of a different reason. It doesn't simply add the explicit restriction \"the container cannot be changed\", it moves the container into immutable iterators, thus you can't change the container. You **can** also use mutable references and change the array, the language itself doesn't really care about you changing the array or not.\r\nI think if we decide to disallow container changes it should be something generic like that, part of the type system, and not just an explicit \"you can't change the array\".",
