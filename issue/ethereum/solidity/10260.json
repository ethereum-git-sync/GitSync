Please note that in order to write this section you would have to be familiar with Solidity and be able to crisply and precisely define what Solidity is about (the high level design rationale and goals of the language). If you feel like to have enough knowledge to do that, feel free to give it a shot. My assumption is that this issue would be easier solvable by a Solidity core team member.\r\n\r\nIt might make sense for you to check issues that are marked with ``good first issue`` to get started. :)\r\n\r\nWith regards to your question, the additional text should go into the intro section of the docs (that's the `index` file of the docs folder).

    "body": "Adding a bit more context to this section. I think it would be nice to cover the following aspects in the intro section of the docs:\r\n\r\n**1. What is Solidity?** \r\n```\r\nSolidity is an object-oriented, high-level language for implementing smart contracts. Smart contracts are programs which govern the behaviour of accounts within the Ethereum state.\r\n\r\nSolidity is a curly-bracket language. It is influenced by C++, Python and JavaScript, and is designed to target the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). You can find more details about which languages Solidity has been inspired by in the language influences section.\r\n\r\nSolidity is statically typed, supports inheritance, libraries and complex user-defined types among other features.\r\n```\r\n**2. Why Solidity?**\r\n\r\nHere we should list aspects that make Solidity a great language.\r\n\r\n**3.  _[optional]_ Who/what is Solidity for?**\r\n\r\nHere we could list who the target group for using Solidity is and what you can do with it.\r\n\r\nStuff that would already fit in this section:\r\n\r\n```\r\nWith Solidity you can create contracts for uses such as voting, crowdfunding, blind auctions,\r\nand multi-signature wallets.\r\n```\r\n\r\n**4. Which design principles are followed/considered when developing Solidity language?**\r\n\r\nHere we could briefly list which aspects are most important to us when we do language design and prioritise them.\r\n",
