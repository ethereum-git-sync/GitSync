Files/contracts/functions from the `stdlib` would need to be explicitly imported, and would not be exposed implicitly. Initially this file would still be part of the compiler source code and included as a literal in the binary, but potentially in the future it could live outside should importing from content addressible locations turn more naturally supported by tools.\r\n\r\nFunctionality we want to move out / include:\r\n1. Function available in the global namespace\r\n2. Functions attached to certain types (such as those on `address`)\r\n3. Potentially things like `block`, `tx`, and `msg`\r\n4. Helpers to be used within assembly\r\n\r\nThere is some initial work available in https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/tree/stdlib\r\n\r\n",

    "body": "I think an option to export the stdlib to the filesystem could be a nice addition to the commandline: ``solc --export-stdlib /my/folder/to/store/it``. Then users could choose to use the built-in stdlib or the ones in a local folder. We have to decide what to do on a name clash. Maybe it would be fine to allow both to be imported in the same way and check for equality. If there is a change, it has to be signalled somehow in the metadata.",
