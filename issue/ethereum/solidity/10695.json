  "body": "Solidity 0.8.0 added built-in, by default, reverts when there is an overflow or underflow in an operation on integers.\r\n\r\nI prefer the explicitness of SafeMath, or my own require statements. Over/underflow reverts by default are not a solve-all for the problem. In some cases revert on over/underflow is the wrong action, for example when it locks funds in a contract forever.\r\n\r\nI don't want to use `unchecked`.  I want to use SafeMath (or equivalent or better library) or my own require statements. This helps ensure that I look and think about each possible over/underflow case and not shotgun use the default functionality and assume it is the right thing to do in every case.\r\n\r\nIn addition, @wjmelements [pointed out](https://twitter.com/willmorriss4/status/1343349368175403009)  it is nice to be able to emit a user-friendly message via require specifying what exactly was under/overflowing.  \r\n\r\n### gas\r\n\r\nThe majority of Solidity for loops increment a uint256 variable that starts at 0. These increment operations never need to be checked for over/underflow because the variable will never reach the max number of uint256 (will run out of gas long before that happens).  The default over/underflow check wastes gas in every iteration of virtually every for loop I would ever write. It can be done unchecked in this awkward way:\r\n\r\n```Solidity\r\nfor(uint256 i; i < 10;) {\r\n  // loop logic\r\n  unchecked { i++; }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nOr possibly an inlined function can be used:\r\n```Solidity\r\nfunction inc(i) internal pure returns (uint256) {\r\n  unchecked { return i + 1; }\r\n}\r\nfor(uint256 i; i < 10; i = inc(i)) {\r\n  // loop logic\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut I would prefer to write my unchecked for loops (which are all of them) in the usual way like this:\r\n\r\n```Solidity\r\nfor(uint256 i; i < 10; i++;) {\r\n  // loop logic         \r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThings possibly could be done to improve the syntax of unchecked for loops. That's great.  But I would just prefer to do without default over/underflow reverts, so I handle each possible over/underflow individually, explicitly and correctly.\r\n\r\n",

    "body": "I think this entire problem will diminish significantly in the future, as soon as our latest optimizer work is done.\r\nIdeally, almost all checks that are introduced by checked arithmetic by default will be automatically removed if you have a custom require up front that assures that the overflow can't happen or if the check is redundant based on any other linear constraint on its values like in the case of common loop increments. Once that is the case, ideally, your bytecode in the end will contain zero auto-generated overflow checks, since you either covered all cases by your own require statements or have cases where you actually want to allow overflows, in which case making it visible using ``unchecked`` is not a bad thing.\r\nYou should even be able use static analysis to make sure you didn't miss any such case :-).\r\n\r\nIn general, the change in default behaviour, i.e. making checked arithmetic the default and moving unchecked arithmetic to a situation like ``SafeMath`` was in before (i.e. if one wanted to, one could imagine an ``UnsafeMath`` library wrapping arithmetic in ``unchecked`` blocks flipping the situation entirely), of course, generally favors people who rely on safe-math checks a lot, resp. are using safe-math almost ubiquitously - unfortunately, from what we've seen this seems to be the majority of cases, so more contracts seem to suffer from the less readable safe-math-style operations than now suffer from the default checks, especially since ``unchecked`` blocks *are* available, so the situation of people who want unchecked maths now is not as bad as the situation of people who wanted checked maths was before. I'm also sceptical about making ``unchecked`` a global pragma-based setting and would point to the easier auditability if ``unchecked`` is as local a property as possible (especially if you consider multi-file projects with imports with differing arithmetic between files, etc.).\r\n\r\nWhat is definitely unfortunate, is that it may take a while until this kind of optimization will be available to production code (it will only happen after we switch to Sol->Yul code generation by default).\r\n\r\nStill, my main question at this point would be: would the ability of the optimizer to remove most or all redundant checks introduced by checked-by-default-arithmetic make a significant difference in your view on the matter?",

The feature has been widely accepted by the community as the way to go, and there is an alternative to use unchecked code via unchecked blocks. Closing as \"won't fix\".",
