The \"locally always overflows\" does not sound like something you write by accident (but maybe I am wrong).\r\nThe other case, where there is some transaction sequence which leads to a state where calling a function will always revert because of overflow, I am not sure if this is possible to detect with the current framework (but again, I might be wrong).",

That is a `panic` that *will* be reached *all the time*. I myself when writing 0.8 contracts do not guard the arithmetic operations with previous requires and just rely on the compiler to filter it out for me.",

Is that really the case?\r\n\r\nWell, I don't think there is complete consensus about that. But I personally would say: most definitely yes, just as relying on SafeMath was doing things badly ;-). Both should always only have been considered as last safety net just in case you messed up and some case slipped through your fingers that *isn't* caught by explicit ``require``'s. I'd still maintain that doing https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/10717#issuecomment-754679759 and having the compiler optimize away the autogenerated check in ``a+b`` would be ideal. And I don't think anyone would actually argue against that being ideal.\r\nHowever in practice the problem is both that this appears to be hardly adhered to by anyone and that the optimizer still has a hard time removing redundant checks like that so far.",
