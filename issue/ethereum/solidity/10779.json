It has the downside that when we introduce a new codegen, almost all test cases need to be modified to disable it. Having the codegen disabled initially does not require that but I think that after eventually making it the default we're going to want to remove the setting in cases where it matches the defaults so we'll be modifying all test cases anyway.",
