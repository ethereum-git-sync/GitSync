It sometimes works without `this` and sometimes doesn't. Behavior is different between for `.selector` and for `.address`. It also changes depending on whether the value is actually used or not.\r\n\r\n## Example\r\n```solidity\r\ncontract B {\r\n    function g() public {}\r\n}\r\n\r\ncontract C is B {\r\n    function h() public  {\r\n        address a1 = g.address;     // Error: Member \"address\" not found or not visible after argument-dependent lookup in function ().\r\n        address a2 = this.g.address;\r\n        address a3 = h.address;     // Error: Member \"address\" not found or not visible after argument-dependent lookup in function ().\r\n        address a4 = this.h.address;\r\n\r\n        g.address;                  // Error: Expected identifier but got 'address'\r\n        this.g.address;             // Error: Expected identifier but got 'address'\r\n        h.address;                  // Error: Expected identifier but got 'address'\r\n        this.h.address;             // Error: Expected identifier but got 'address'\r\n\r\n        bytes4 s1 = g.selector;\r\n        bytes4 s2 = this.g.selector;\r\n        bytes4 s3 = h.selector;     // Error: Member \"selector\" not found or not visible after argument-dependent lookup in function ().\r\n        bytes4 s4 = this.h.selector;\r\n\r\n        g.selector;\r\n        this.g.selector;\r\n        h.selector;                 // Error: Member \"selector\" not found or not visible after argument-dependent lookup in function ().\r\n        this.h.selector;\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Environment\r\n- Compiler version: 0.8.1\r\n- Operating system: Arch Linux",

    "body": "A bit weird to now double-discuss this with https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/10891 :-). Short version of what I said there: the fact that ``g.selector`` is valid is a side-effect of ``B.g.selector`` being valid and us assigning both of them the same type internally. The latter works and should work (that was an explicit feature request), even if used from a contract that does not inherit from ``B``. So yeah, it might be nice to disallow ``g.selector`` there, but it'll probably involve some tinkering, since there are cases that currently have the same types that should be allowed.",
