  "body": "From https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/10976#discussion_r578594268\r\n\r\n## Abstract\r\nCurrently the compiler ignores any number of slashes at the end of the name of an imported module. For example this test case is perfectly valid:\r\n\r\n```solidity\r\n==== Source: a/b/c.sol ====\r\ncontract C {}\r\n==== Source: a/b/d.sol ====\r\nimport \"./c.sol/\";\r\ncontract D is C {}\r\n```\r\n\r\nI think that this should result in a compilation error instead. Only `import \"./c.sol\";` should be accepted.\r\n\r\n## Motivation\r\nI see no legitimate need for these trailing slashes. I haven't seen this used in practice and if I did, I would probably be confused by it - Solidity does not currently allow importing whole directories but it looks like such an import.\r\n\r\nIt's also a source of bugs due to libraries not supporting all edge cases correctly (e.g. #10713). Disallowing this would free us from worrying about some of these edge cases.\r\n\r\n## Specification\r\nIf the path passed to `import` ends with `/`, the compiler should issue an error saying that it's not possible to import a directory. For consistency, the compiler might also issue this error if it determines that an import not ending with a slash is pointing at a directory.\r\n\r\nAlternatively, given that user might not understand that the compiler sees a file with a trailing slash as a directory, the message could just say that imported paths cannot end with a slash.\r\n\r\n## Backwards Compatibility\r\nThis will break code that uses this style of import. Such code is easy to fix by removing the slash but it's still a breaking change.",
