    "body": "The issue https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/1256 proposes that the conversion should be allowed.\r\n\r\nMy arguments for disallowing it would be:\r\n1. Calling such functions from the frontend becomes more complicated. For example, if there is `f(uint)` and `f(uint128)`, calling either of them from the front-end is not as straightforward as `contract.f(10)`. Even though frontends seem to have support for calling them [ether.js: overloaded functions](https://docs.ethers.io/v5/migration/web3/) and [web3.py: invoke ambigous functions](https://web3py.readthedocs.io/en/stable/contracts.html#invoke-ambiguous-contract-functions-example)\r\n2. Allowing it would mean adding more rules to reference resolution.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, we have the following issues if this is disallowed:\r\n1. Unable to write interfaces to contracts that have already implemented this. Both existing solidity contracts, and contracts from other languages.\r\n2. Perhaps this would affect templated functions. Say for templated function `f<T>(T val)`, this might mean that `f<uint>` and `f<uint128>` cannot coexist.",
