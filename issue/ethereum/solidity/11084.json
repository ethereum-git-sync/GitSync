  "body": "Questions about the runs parameter come up many times (e.g. [1](https://gitter.im/ethereum/solidity-dev?at=5dd19f14fd6fe41fc0a0a2a5), [2](https://gitter.im/ethereum/solidity-dev?at=60411fe422a5ce4a9132fb16)). Many cases people think runs here equals to the number of optimizer runs.\r\n\r\nThe `runs` parameter is described as \"Estimated number of calls per opcode oven the lifetime of the contract.\" in the source code. If we strictly look at the runs parameter meaning the above, then the default of 200 means \"the contract will be executed around 200 times\" (of course it is more subtle than that). This probably is a good average value for a contract wallet. It is not a good value for a popular app.\r\n\r\nI have not seen too many contracts where people changed from the default 200 (one notable exception is the eth2.0 deposit contract).\r\n\r\nIt perhaps may be better to consider a new setting instead: optimize for deploy-time-cost (i.e. `runs=1`) or run-time-cost (i.e. `runs=<large value>`). What is unclear what is the good \"runs\" value and whether very large numbers make any difference.\r\n\r\n@ekpyron also mentioned the new low-level inline uses the same setting. Also things like Optimism (which injects code adding quite a large overhead to every single state accessing opcode) could benefit if this new setting would control the level of inlining in the codegen and optimisation steps (i.e. controlling code size).",

Maybe it would be better to choose something clearer but still preserving the original meaning (unless we go for a new setting and just remove it altogether)?

This could be a binary search that only repeats the steps that depend on the parameter, although that could be difficult as soon as the yul optimizer is used.",

    "body": "@michaeljohnbennett You'll probably need to compile contracts with different values for `--optimize-runs`. Then deploy and call some functions. You can notice the difference in gas costs for them; both deployment and for each call. If you are more keen, look at the assembly code: https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.7/analysing-compilation-output.html or the IR `--ir-optimized --optimize`. If you have questions, then https://app.element.io/#/room/#ethereum_solidity:gitter.im is the right place to ask. ",

An optimal sizing script? It doesn't seem a terribly complex thing to do.\r\n\r\n1. Iterate over a set of runs values (100-10000)\r\n2. For each one calc contract costs\r\n3. for a set of public calls calculate the gas costs for a simple set of params\r\n4. record the data in some tabular format for each iteration and save to disk or tabulate.\r\n\r\n",
