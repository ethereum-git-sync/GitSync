  "body": "## Abstract\r\n\r\nAllow the compiler to create a smart contract hub that connects multiple smart contracts together to have a single entry point without being limited to the 24 kb limit of Solidity. \r\n\r\nThe proposal is to introduce syntax for creating a hub contract which acts as a single entry point for complex smart contract systems and proxies calls to different implementation contracts using delegate calls. The hub contract will store all of the storage for its child contracts under separate namespaces. The child contract can be standard contracts or new abstract/library like contracts.\r\n\r\n## Motivation\r\n\r\nComplex dApps require complex smart contracts. I have seen a lot of dApp developers struggle with this. As Ethereum and Solidity have progressed over the years, you can’t really do as much in 24KB as you were used to. Solc bakes in more checks, reason strings take a lot of space, and L2 solutions like Optimism bloat the compiled artifacts with their changes.\r\n\r\nA lot of alternative non-standard solutions are being used right now that introduce another attack surface and added complexity. Having something inbuilt in the compiler will make it safer and easier for developers to build complex smart contract systems.\r\n\r\n## Specification\r\n\r\n- The hub smart contract must specify all child contracts that it will route. The syntax can be something like `contract Hub routing Foo, Bar`. It must work alongside the `is` keyword. I.e. `contract Hub routing Foo, Bar is Proxy` should also work.\r\n- The hub should have a binary searchable router to route all calls to appropriate child contracts using delegate calls.\r\n- The child contracts must import the Hub if they want to access the hub’s storage or route calls to other child contracts. If the child contract is independent of the hub, it does not need to do anything special. I.e. Existing contracts can be used as child contracts. The syntax for importing the hub remains the same as the syntax for importing other contracts. `import ./Hub.sol`.\r\n- Once the hub is imported, the child contracts can access storage and functions of the hub and other routed contracts via `Hub.variable`, `Hub.Foo.variable`, `Hub.Bar.function()` etc.\r\n- If a storage is accessed, the storage should be read/written directly from the pre-defined storage slot rather than making any external calls.\r\n- If a function in an another module is called, a delegate call must be made to self that the hub can route to the proper destination.\r\n- The storage of child contracts must be stored in their own namespace, derived by hashing something like “child_contract” + $child_contract_name. Sort of like how mappings work.\r\n- The hub should be compiled/deployed like contracts that use libraries are compiled/deployed. All child contracts must be deployed individually and then the hub’s code must be updated to include hardcoded addresses of the child contracts.\r\n\r\n## Example Syntax\r\n\r\n```solidity\r\n\r\ncontract Hub routes Foo, Bar {\r\n    string name;\r\n\r\n    function setName(string memory newName) public {\r\n        name = newName;\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\ncontract Foo {\r\n    uint value;\r\n\r\n    function incrementValue() public {\r\n        value += 1;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    function test() public view returns (string memory) {\r\n        return “hello”;\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\ncontract Bar {\r\n    uint value; // Different than Foo.value;\r\n\r\n    function incrementFooValue() public {\r\n        if (Hub.Foo.value < 42) {\r\n            Hub.Foo.incrementValue();\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nps Thanks to @ajsantander, @chriseth, @cameel, and others who have helped form this draft proposal.

Then we could access storage variables via `foo.varName`, call functions as `foo.f()`, make the construction explicit either via `Foo immutable foo = new Foo()` or via assignment from the constructor. Furthermore, if it is not immutable, we can use it for upgrades. One missing piece is now the routing, but maybe we can have that as a statement inside the contract: `using functions from foo, bar;`?\r\n\r\nIn general, I somehow feel that the main new feature this adds to the language is the dispatch, isn't it?

    "body": "> I guess the idea is to split the creation into multiple transactions, so that they can go over the tx size limit, right?\r\n\r\nEvery module will be deployed in a separate transaction, thus you can have as many modules as you want. The hub will be deployed in a single transaction through so there's a practical limit on the size of routing table you can fit in but that should be quite large.\r\n\r\n> If we know that the delegated contracts / modules do not have additional publicly visible functions and also no fallback functions, we can use some optimization techniques in the dispatch routine.\r\n\r\nI don't think we can assume that. How substantial are the optimizations mentioned here? We can consider adding these constraints but we'll then have to educate the users as well.\r\n\r\n> Furthermore, it would be very nice if this proposal could eliminate the need for fallback functions altogether. This means it would be great if this could also be used to implement contract upgrades.\r\n\r\nI thought about this a bit but couldn't find an elegant way to do it. Do you have any suggestions?\r\n\r\n> And finally, what do you think about specifying instances of the sub-contracts directly as in Foo immutable foo;?\r\n\r\n`immutable` are fine but `mutable` might be misunderstood by the users (devs using solidity). Since the routing table will be hardcoded in the bytecode, even if we allowed changing module addresses, people won't be able to add/remove modules or even functions in those modules. This severely limits the types of upgrades you can do and end users may not realize this quirk. Although supporting `mutable` instances won't be super complex, I'd err on the side of caution and not allow them at all to protect users from themselves.\r\n\r\n> In general, I somehow feel that the main new feature this adds to the language is the dispatch, isn't it?\r\n\r\nDispatcher is the main bit but another important piece of the puzzle is namespaced storage on per module basis. Namespacing storage allows different modules to statically calculate storage slots for each other while still allowing individual modules to add items to their storage. It also prevents clashes between same name storages between different modules.\r\n",
