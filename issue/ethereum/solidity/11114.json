  "body": "It is impossible to define multiple events with the same signature in the same contract. This lead to the design that the user documentation (\"NatSpec\") has a mapping of event signatures to the description of the event.\r\n\r\nWhat has been possible for a while now is for a contract to emit events with the same signature but different natspec through the use of libraries or via referencing events of a different contract.. The events emitted this way were ignored in the natspec output so far.\r\n\r\nWe now have different options to solve this situation:\r\n - change the natspec json to use arrays instead of direct objects\r\n - only use \"the first\" non-empty natspec (prioritize the event in the current contract or a base and then use AST IDs for priorization)\r\n - somehow combine the documentations (difficult for parameters etc)\r\n - issue a warning if such a clash happens",

Feel free to edit this if I missed something:\r\n\r\n-   Discussion on a solution about NatSpec when events with same\r\n    signature are defined in different scopes.\r\n    -   Only relevant after the new callgraph for Events that can detect\r\n        events emitted inside libraries and free functions.\r\n-   Some *initial agreement* about changing the 'value' field for\r\n    event signature in JSON to be an array instead of object.\r\n-   @axic: better to include other NatSpec changes along with this\r\n    change.\r\n-   @chriseth mentioned that the situation is identical for errors.\r\n    -   Although, towards the end, mentioned that currently errors will\r\n        not have signature collisions, so making it an array is not\r\n        necessary.\r\n-   Question: Should we always change the 'value' field for Events and\r\n    Errors to be an array, or only when there are repetitions?\r\n    -   Opinion (@cameel, @hrkrshnn, @axic(?)) it's better to keep it as\r\n        an array always for consistency.\r\n    -   @chriseth mentioned to implement Error NatSpec as arrays right\r\n        away. Change of opinion towards the end (see point above.)\r\n-   @axic mentioned that the NatSpec version field can be updated if\r\n    we change object into array.\r\n    -   Discussed whether this has to be done on Solidity breaking as\r\n        well. *Agreement* on how bumping NatSpec version is sufficient.\r\n-   @aarlt: we should not allow Events with same signature. Convert\r\n    them into a warning or an error at the contract.\r\n    -    *No clear agreement* about what should be done for Events after this.\r\n-   Asking about a solution that can be implemented this week.\r\n    -   @chriseth mentioned that he'll proceed with just Objects for\r\n        Errors, which is what's currently implemented. And decide about\r\n        events later.\r\n\r\n",
