  "body": "## Motivation\r\n\r\nWhen writing Solidity, the developer oftentimes has written code which makes assumptions that the compiler cannot know. An example would be the existence of a contract such as a Uniswap pool or an ERC20 token. If I know that contract exists, I should not need to pay additional gas to check that it exists!\r\n\r\nA simple example, is a dev having to write the following (h/t @moodysalem):\r\n\r\n```solidity\r\n// fetch the token balance of an address without triggering an EXTCODESIZE\r\nfunction balanceOf(address token, address owner) internal view returns (uint256) {\r\n        (bool success, bytes memory data) =\r\n            token.staticcall(abi.encodeWithSelector(IERC20.balanceOf.selector, owner));\r\n        require(success && data.length == 32);\r\n        return abi.decode(data, (uint256));\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Specification\r\n\r\nThere should be an option in the solc compiler (a la Rust’s #[cfg(feature = \"...\") directive) allowing you to skip some kinds of \"standard\" checks w/o having to do it manually (e.g. writing a addreor dropping to assembly, e.g. skipping an EXTCODESIZE when *CALLING to a contract you know exists.\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n```solidity\r\nIERC20 token = IERC20(...)\r\n\r\n\r\n#[cfg(contract_exists)]\r\ntoken.balanceOf(address(this))\r\n````\r\n\r\nThe above should skip generating the EXTCODESIZE part of the bytecode.\r\n\r\nThis is similar to the `unsafe` keyword, but a bit more specialized to disable specific safety checks than everything. We would need to figure out which categories of commonly-done optimizations exist.\r\n\r\n* Existence Checks\r\n* Overflow Checks\r\n* ..what else?\r\n\r\n## Backwards Compatibility\r\n\r\nThis should be fully backwards compatible.",

There are two things the check guards against: no contract at the address yet (either because you have wrong address or contract has not been deployed yet) or contract destroyed. And given that `SELFDESTRUCT` will likely be removed in the future, the former is much more important. How about we let users declare dependencies - contract addresses that must already be occupied at deployment time. We generate constructor code to check them once and after that we know these contracts exist so we can skip `EXTCODESIZE` on external calls to such addresses.",
