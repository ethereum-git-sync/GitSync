  "body": "Proposal:\r\n\r\nContext: reading this -- https://blog.soliditylang.org/2021/02/10/an-introduction-to-soliditys-fuzz-testing-approach/\r\n\r\nFrom this and conversation with @bshastry I know there is a Yul optimization mode that, as I understand at, adds extra (possibly expensive?) checks to the validity of optimizations, used in the Yul protobuf fuzzing.  I believe this works for arbitrary Yul, so for anything that would hit the optimizer.  I've been thinking about how to improve fuzzing for compilers in general, and one approach would be to just add a --slow-but-checked mode where a compiler may even be too slow for production use most of the time, but runs as many additional sanity checks as anyone is willing to code up.  This article (https://cfallin.org/blog/2021/03/15/cranelift-isel-3/) that @rocallahan pointed me to got me thinking along these lines.  As Rob has pointed out, it might even be worth compiling Mars code/systems code/high value contracts using such a compiler mode, even if it was very slow, as a defense against wrong code.  In this case, it seems to me the check code exists and might not be too hard to integrate into the solc normal front end as an optional added check, maybe to be joined by others.\r\n\r\nThis is basically \"solfuzzer binary on steroids, in main binary\" I guess...",

Is it meant to permit external testers to simply focus on input generation and feed such inputs to a mode such as `solc  --fuzz-yul-optimizer input.yul`?\n\nThere is already the possibility of building the fuzzers we already have and simply wiring it with one's own input generator.

The optimised version optimises out `addr` because it is unused.\r\n\r\nThe main question is if we should support `linkersymbol` as a valid built-in inside the Yul interpreter but that's a separate issue :-)\r\n\r\nBTW, the test case is probably from yul syntax test suite: https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/develop/test/libyul/yulSyntaxTests/linkersymbol_evm.yul",
