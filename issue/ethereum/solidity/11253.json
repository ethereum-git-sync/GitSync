It is the same kind of state mutability narrowing.\r\n\r\n## Motivation\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/issues/2610\r\n\r\nERC721's `transferFrom` is defined as payable in the spec. Our standard implementation is not payable, because if it were payable we would have to define what to do with the message value, which isn't standardized so we don't want to define a specific way to handle it.\r\n\r\nBecause our implementation isn't payable, we've also defined the `interface` as non-payable, but people have pointed out that 1) this is more restrictive than the spec, and 2) there is no way to extend our implementation (through inheritance) to make it payable and add logic to handle msg.value.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Specification\r\n\r\nA nonPayable function should be a valid implementation of a payable function.\r\n\r\nA child contract should be able to extend our nonPayable implementation with a payable function to add a way to handle msg.value before forwarding to `super.transferFrom`.\r\n",

    "body": "I see... I think this is due to a different interpretation of what payable and non-payable mean. The situation is not exactly the same as non-view/view/pure, because in that case the default is the least strict (non-view), and with non-payable/payable the default is the most strict (non-payable).\r\n\r\nIn my mind, `payable` is the meaningful one and is a way to declare that you want to _accept_ value. But if the compiler sees non-payable as a way to declare that you want to _reject_ value, these are two perspectives that will arrive at different expectations for how overrides should behave.\r\n\r\n`C is I, A` says `C` conforms to both `I` and `A`, but then you could say: a) at least one of `I`,`A` wants to accept value so `C` will accept it, or b) at least one of `I`,`A` wants to reject value so `C` will reject it.\r\n\r\nI don't really have a strong opinion here... Although the motivation to open this issue was so that we could have `IERC721.transferFrom` as payable, then implement the core logic in `ERC721.transferFrom` as non-payable, while still allowing users to use the core logic and add value-handling logic on top. If this is considered widening and will not be allowed, it won't fix this use case. It may be complicated to allow that scenario in a solid way, so I would understand it.",

    "body": "What are your opinions if we add a `nonPayable` attribute, that would be required a compilation to narrow a function shadowed from payable to non-payable? \r\n\r\nBecause I can see the case of a developer using a library, shadowing a `payable` function, and forgetting to keep it payable. So having it explicit helps to understand that its the intent of the developper.\r\n\r\nSo the rules would be something like:\r\n- default: non-payable\r\n- `payable`: only possible if it does not shadow a non-payable function\r\n- `nonPayable`: only way to shadow a payable function without being payable (otherwise same behavior as the default)\r\n\r\n\r\nHowever, as the current proposal does not solve OZ problem, and I am not aware of any large project that needs this feature, I am not sure it's worth adding complexity here, and we can just keep the existing rules ;)",
