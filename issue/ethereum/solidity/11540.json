  "body": "`this` is sometimes necessary to clarify that a function of the current contract is being accessed as an external one. The compiler currently warns about every use of it in a constructor, which drives users away from using it in even innocuous constructs like simply getting a function selector:\r\n\r\n```solidity\r\ncontract C {\r\n    function ext() external {}\r\n    function pub() public {}\r\n\r\n    constructor() {\r\n        this.ext.selector;\r\n        this.pub.selector;\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n```\r\nWarning: \"this\" used in constructor. Note that external functions of a contract cannot be called while it is being constructed.\r\n --> test.sol:6:9:\r\n  |\r\n6 |         this.ext.selector;\r\n  |         ^^^^\r\n\r\nWarning: \"this\" used in constructor. Note that external functions of a contract cannot be called while it is being constructed.\r\n --> test.sol:7:9:\r\n  |\r\n7 |         this.pub.selector;\r\n  |\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is actually the \"correct\" way to get the selector (#10905). Sometimes it's also possible to get the selector via unqualified access or via contract name but it does not work in all situations. I think that the compiler should not warn when it's just the selector that's being accessed. \r\n\r\nI think that it might be better to also omit the warning in any case where the function is not being directly called. For example when it's only assigned to a pointer. There are valid situations where such a pointer is only called at runtime so the warning is a bit overzealous:\r\n\r\n```solidity\r\ncontract C {\r\n    function () external handler;\r\n\r\n    constructor(bool useA) {\r\n        if (useA)\r\n            handler = this.a;\r\n        else\r\n            handler = this.b;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    function a() external {}\r\n    function b() external {}\r\n\r\n    function test() public {\r\n        handler();\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Environment\r\n\r\n- Compiler version: 0.8.5",

E.g. as an extension of the second case in the issue description consider:\r\n```\r\ninterface I { function f() external; }\r\n\r\ncontract C is I {\r\n        function () external handlerA;\r\n        function () external handlerB;\r\n        constructor(I x, bool flag) {\r\n                if (flag) {\r\n                        handlerA = this.f;\r\n                        handlerB = x.f;\r\n                } else {\r\n                        handlerA = x.f;  \r\n                        handlerB = this.f;\r\n                }\r\n\r\n                if (flag) {\r\n                        handlerB();\r\n                } else {\r\n                        handlerA();\r\n                }\r\n        }\r\n        function f() external override {}\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is technically a fine use of ``this``, but we most definitely don't want to go out of our way to determine that.\r\n\r\nSo defining the precise subset of cases that are fine to accept is the tricky part here.\r\n\r\nWe could restrict to *only* ``this.f.selector``, but that's also weird special-casing without also accepting ``(this).f.selector``... and then it continues to the question of ``(f ? this : this).f.selector``...",
