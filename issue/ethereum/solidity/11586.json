Total cost would be\r\n- If condition + `jumpi`: 25\r\n- Body: `3 + 6*n` (for calldatacopy) + 21 for the rest.\r\n\r\nThe total cost for loop would be `25 + 64 * n` whereas it's `49 + 6*n` for the if condition, where `n` is the number of iterations.\r\n\r\n(In practice, a user reported that a certain function after the change went from `3k` to `700` gas!)\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Implementation\r\n\r\nOne way to implement this is similar to pattern matching in `ExpressionSimplifier`.\r\n\r\nWe match\r\n\r\n```\r\nfor { } lt(X, Y) { Z := add(Z, 1) }\r\n{\r\n    mstore(U, calldataload(V))\r\n    U := add(U, 32)\r\n    V := add(V, 32)\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nand replace it by \r\n\r\n```\r\nif lt(X, Y) {\r\n    calldatacopy(U, V, mul(32, sub(Y, X)))\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhere `X`, `Y`, `U` and `V` should match only identifiers or literals.\r\n\r\n--- \r\n## Other loops.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, also for `returndata`.",

    "body": "We were thinking about a pattern matching system that can match Yul syntax beyond expressions previously (I guess there is also an issue).\r\n\r\nFor this particular case, we have the additional requirements that:\r\n - `X` and `Y` are movable\r\n -  `Z`, `U` and `V` are never read after the for loop\r\n\r\n(I actually think that `X` and `Z` should be the same variable)\r\n\r\nThe second condition can be removed by changing the replacement so that `U`, `V` and `X`/`Z` are just incremented accordingly. Another optimizer stage should remove this assignment if they are never read afterwards.\r\n\r\nAlso, potentially wrapping behaviour should be taken into account for the condition.",
