  "body": "The SMTChecker's usability is still not great, especially for new users.\r\nWhen running the SMTChecker on large contracts with the default settings, users are often bombarded with warnings about targets the solver couldn't prove, and verifying all contracts at the same time makes the encoding very large.\r\nA few items that could be improved:\r\n\r\n- [x] There is a lot of noise about targets that the solver could not prove. One idea is to compress all of those into a single warning by default, saying `128 verification conditions could not be proved. Consider choosing a single contract to be verified. To see the full list of unproved targets, enable model checker verbosity to 2` for example. This would also highlight problems that are actually confirmed.\r\n- [x] Underflow/overflow verification conditions create A LOT of targets which really bloats the solver. IMO, these should not be checked by default for Solidity >=0.8.0 since most people do rely on the compiler's built-in checks. Conclusion, I think we should not check for underflow/overflow by default for Solidity >=0.8.0.\r\n- [ ] Choosing a single contract to be verified increases performance a lot. Somehow deciding on a single contract (or a few) by default could also improve usability a lot.\r\n- [ ] Filter unsupported warnings by target contract reachability https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/11703",

    "body": "@cameel @leonardoalt Hey, thanks for the questions and comments. I'm speaking more from a consumer's perspective and that is indeed the experience I personally went through, which is 1) wondering what SMT is; 2) googling it for answers and got a bunch of solidity SMTChecker articles with no full name; 3) ah, found one link about `Satisfiability Modulo Theories`, but not sure if it is the one; 4) going through more links and found no direct answer. I think by having a full name explicitly displayed on the doc, readers can have the certainty that SMT is `Satisfiability Modulo Theories`, since new users do not necessarily have the knowledge to make the judgement. \r\n\r\nIt's good to know SMT is linked to a wiki page, and I have to say only until this moment did I know it is linked to the wiki page I found by googling. Besides, I've been reading the solidity doc in pdf on my pad, so clicking on it is just somehow infeasible.",
