Consider disabling the Yul optimizer:\r\n> ...\r\n> If you do the second option and it works, could you please follow up?\r\n\r\nHowdy all. Just wanted to let you know I did Option 2 and it fixed my problem. \r\n\r\nI was adding the [diamond proxy contracts](https://github.com/mudgen/diamond-2) by @mudgen to my project (which is being compiled with 0.8.5). Even though his project was not getting the error, I was consistently getting the following in mine after adding his contracts:\r\n\r\n```\r\nCompilerError: Stack too deep when compiling inline assembly: Variable headStart is 1 slot(s) too deep inside the stack.\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe only difference was that @mudgen's `hardhat.config.js` had super simple config:\r\n\r\n```\r\nmodule.exports = {\r\n  solidity: '0.8.6'\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nI personally had more going on:\r\n\r\n```\r\n  solidity: {\r\n    version: \"0.8.5\",\r\n    settings: {\r\n      optimizer: {\r\n        enabled: true,\r\n        runs: 200\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n  },\r\n```\r\n\r\nI had previously discovered that setting `optimizer` to `false` in my config would get rid of the error, but I don't want to go live like that so it wasn't a solution. Then I found @hrkrshnn's post about turning off YUL optimizer\r\n\r\n```\r\n  solidity: {\r\n    version: \"0.8.5\",\r\n    settings: {\r\n      optimizer: {\r\n        enabled: true,\r\n        runs: 200,\r\n        details: {\r\n          yul: false\r\n        }\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\nMy only question now is what the effect of disabling the YUL optimizer will be.",

    "body": "Unfortunately not, because at the stage where the problem happens the connection between your original source and the part that is being processed is pretty tenuous. The code is already after conversion to Yul, optimization (including inlining) and is being translated from Yul to EVM bytecode. The Yul source being compiled is just a big dump of code from your contract and any other contracts/functions it calls internally. The information about which parts of your original source this Yul code maps to is either unavailable or unreliable. We'd like to improve error reporting for that case (#12449) but there isn't much that can be done without guessing, and in the end focusing more on features that will make these errors happen less seems more productive.",
