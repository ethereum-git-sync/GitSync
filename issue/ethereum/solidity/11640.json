    "body": "@fluidsonic Ah, yes. Solidity does have short-circuiting. I mixed up solidity and Yul. \r\n\r\nGenerally, such optimizations would be done at the Yul level, so, the argument about short-circuiting for  `if and(expr1, expr2) { ... }` would still be true. Regardless, I would be interested in seeing the results of your tests.\r\n\r\n----\r\nAt the solidity level, changing `if (a && b)` to `if(a) { if (b) ...}`, even for identifiers, would make a difference.\r\n\r\nFor the former case, the Yul code would look like\r\n\r\n```\r\n                        let value0 := a\r\n                        let value1 := b\r\n                        let expr := value0\r\n                        if value0 { expr := value1 }\r\n                        if expr\r\n                        {\r\n                            ...\r\n                        }\r\n```\r\n \r\nIn the latter case, it would look like:\r\n\r\n```\r\n                        let value0 := a\r\n                        let value1 := b\r\n                        if value0\r\n                        {\r\n                            if value1\r\n                            {\r\n                               ...\r\n                            }\r\n                        }\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo if the `if` condition is not met, you would save one `jumpi` and some checks for it.\r\n\r\nMaybe we can think about combining `if` statements at the Yul level, somehow.",
