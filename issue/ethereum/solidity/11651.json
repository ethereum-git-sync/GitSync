  "body": "Looks like `soldity-upgrade` has input file processing logic duplicated from `CommandLineInterface.cpp`. Especially [`readInputFiles()` and file reader callback in `SourceUpgrade.cpp`](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/v0.8.6/tools/solidityUpgrade/SourceUpgrade.cpp#L417-L527). This logic in `CommandLineInterface` has recently been refactored in PRs like #11113, #11518. After #11545/#11617 will actually become functionally different so `solidity-upgrade` will be unable to resolve imports exactly the same way `solc` does so projects that depend on `--base-path` being set properly might no longer compile.\r\n\r\nLogic needs to be unified in both places. Both should use `FileReader` and its callback. Preferably the input processing inside `readInputFiles()` itself should be shared between the two executables. I think that `solidity-upgrade` also needs `--base-path` option.",
