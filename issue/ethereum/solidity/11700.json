I think the comparison operators does not belong with the ContractType. Even the equality operator is questionable. Disallowing all these operators is especially important to be consistent with how operators are disallowed by default in user defined types: https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/11531.",

    "body": "> With != and == it's not so clear but I would also be in favor of disallowing it.\r\n\r\nThe following may be a reason to disallow it: does it mean comparison between the type or the instance? The type may be equal in the case the child contract has no changes (`contract B is A {}`), but what should it return in case the underlying address is different?  Because of this confusing aspect, it is better not to allow comparison of instances, but potentially allow comparison of the type, and of course comparison of the address is supported via explicit cast.",
