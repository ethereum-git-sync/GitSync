    "body": "Just a general idea: maybe SMTChecker should have some kind of \"lite\" mode meant to give you the best bang for the buck? I.e. it would disable warnings like these where they just *might* be hiding some problem and would avoid only the targets that are likely to give many false-positives, like the overflow checks. In general it would not give user the expectation that the results are complete and would instead do what it can to avoid listing spurious problems. There would also be one easy flag to enable this mode.\r\n\r\nHaving something like this might make the verbosity of the complete output less of an issue because you'd only see it when you are prepared to go through the code with a fine-toothed comb.",

    "body": "I think it's fine to even make such mode the default. We already made the default not run underflow/overflow, maybe we could even remove out of bounds because that might yield a lot of checks, maybe we could *only* check asserts by default. But I don't think we should just disable these warnings, they can be a good indicator of why you got a certain result. I actually like the approach from solc-verify, they just bundle these things together (like we also did with the unproved targets), and say \"X unsupported things/errors, use --show-errors to see all). We could do the same here, then you only get two messages max about unproved/unsupported stuff, and you can expand at a later run if you want. Would this be aligned with your suggestion?",

The advantage is that you force the user to understand the output better but the downside is that it might not be as convenient for regular light usage.

The \"lite\" mode would be better off as something you have to explicitly request because by design it would not try to do a thorough job and user should not be misled into thinking that it's all SMTChecker does.",
