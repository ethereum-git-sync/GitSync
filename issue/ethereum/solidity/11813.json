  "body": "This is a part of #10269 but getting includes consistent also came up recently in #11812 as it might prevent bugs like #11811 and #11103. I'm creating a more focused issue to try out specifically [include-what-you-use](https://include-what-you-use.org) even if it does not solve the original problem as a whole.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThe task here is to install [include-what-you-use](https://include-what-you-use.org) locally and run it on our codebase. Then submit changes in a PR so that we can discuss them and decide if it's good enough to add it as a PR check that runs automatically (it could run as a part of the [`chk_coding_style` job](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/v0.8.7/.circleci/config.yml#L320-L336)). Please also post all the commands you used for installing/building/running it.\r\n\r\nThe main criterion is whether it's reliable enough and does not cause too many false positives that would have to be ignored in some way or, worse, would make the check fail on perfectly valid PRs. Please also make sure that it works not only with our own headers but also with ones from STL and other libraries.",
