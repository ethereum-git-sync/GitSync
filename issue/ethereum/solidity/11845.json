This is because different versions of Z3 sometimes give different (but still valid) results and it's hard to create a test harness that could account for these differences. Instead we compare results verbatim. Because of this we sometimes get reports about broken tests when people build from source and use older Z3.\r\n\r\nWe don't want to raise the minimum version for `solc` but we could improve the situation by doing it for `soltest` and `isoltest`. Then anyone wanting to use them would have to have the latest Z3 or none at all (if an older version is installed it can always be disabled by passing `-DUSE_Z3=OFF` to cmake).",

    "body": "@leonardoalt Do you mean automatically disabling these commandline tests when Z3 is not available? We do not do that in `soltest` and `--no-smt` is required instead. I think we should just add support for this flag in `cmdlineTests.sh` as well (and, by extension, in `tests.sh`) and require user to explicitly disable them.\r\n\r\n@soroosh-sdi \r\n> - Also, in the tessuite we have `SMTCheckerTest` which should be disabled if we don't have any model checker OR z3's version < 4.8.12; fortunately we can do something about it in Cmake\r\n\r\nI don't think it should be disabled automatically. We do not want tests to be skipped silently by accident. We've been through that with semantic tests already (see https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/11374#issuecomment-839588979). We want them skipped only if the `--no-smt` flag is used.\r\n\r\nI think we should focus on the simple case where `soltest` is built with older Z3. A build error should give the user enough clue that Z3 needs to be updated.\r\n\r\nThe case where someone has older Z3 and actively disables it with `-DUSE_Z3=OFF` is trickier. All SMT tests are expected to fail in that case and we expect user to use the `--no-smt` flag. Perhaps some warning would be appropriate in this case after all?",

    "body": "There was some discussion in the PR about whether this should be an error: https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/11873#discussion_r706342315\r\n\r\nSo #11873 covers the build-time check and the `--no-smt` flag. The last part will be the runtime check in `soltest`/`isoltest`. Here are some pointers on the implementation:\r\n- I'd put the check in [`CommonOptions::validate()`](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/dea1b9ec7995ff7f16cdee7925a5858c5ce33982/test/Common.cpp#L112-L137).\r\n    - There should be an error if Z3 version is not the latest one and `--no-smt` is not used.\r\n    - There should be a warning if Z3 is not available at all and `--no-smt` is not used.\r\n- You'll need to add a method for checking Z3 version to [`Z3Interface`](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/develop/libsmtutil/Z3Interface.cpp).\r\n    - If Z3 has been loaded dynamically, version can be obtained from `Z3_get_version()` (see how [`Z3Loader::available()`](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/dea1b9ec7995ff7f16cdee7925a5858c5ce33982/libsmtutil/Z3Loader.cpp#L48-L58) does it).\r\n    -  If it's static, you can use the `Z3_XXX_VERSION` constants.\r\n- We can't perform this check in `cmdlineTests.sh` without something like #6228. I think it's not a big problem because it's unlikely that someone will run just the command-line tests and ignore `soltest`.\r\n    - One thing we should change though would be to run `soltest` before `cmdlineTests.sh` in [`scripts/tests.sh`](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/develop/scripts/tests.sh).\r\n\r\n@ekpyron Does `Z3Loader::available()` also cover the static Z3 or do we need a separate check for that case?",

The best place to add this is probably a static function in ``Z3Interface`` next to ``Z3Interface::available()``.\r\n``test/libsolidity/SMTCheckerTest.cpp:L47`` is where tests that require Z3 are disabled, if no Z3 is available at all.\r\nIt might also be fine to just add another check after that along the lines of ``if (m_modelCheckerSettings.solvers.z3 && <queried z3 version is not latest>) { /* raise error or just print warning and */ m_modelCheckerSettings.solvers.z3 = false; }``.\r\n\r\n> @ekpyron Does Z3Loader::available() also cover the static Z3 or do we need a separate check for that case?\r\n\r\nAh, yeah, just saw the question now.
