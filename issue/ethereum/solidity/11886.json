  "body": "# The problem:\r\n\r\ntry/catch construct was added to allow easily handle reverts when calling functions.\r\nHowever, it gives false sense of security, since there are cases where reverts are \"leaked\" through\r\n\r\n## Example\r\n\r\nThe following code looks safe, since the call is covered by catch-all try/catch.\r\nBut in fact, it reverts\r\n\r\n```solidity\r\ninterface Istr {\r\n    function retstr() external view returns(string memory);\r\n}\r\n\r\ncontract Test {\r\n    \r\n    function asd() external {\r\n        try Istr(address(this)).retstr() returns(string memory ret) {\r\n            emit Debug(ret);\r\n        } catch {\r\n            emit Debug('reverted');\r\n            \r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    function retstr() external  returns (uint) {\r\n        return 1;\r\n    }\r\n    event Debug(string mesg);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Root cause\r\nwhile try/catch does catch all reverts by the external call, it doesn't handle any local handling of the **response**.\r\nThe above example receives a \"uint\" return value, but tries to parse it as dynamic content (string), and the decoder reverts.\r\n\r\nThere are other cases where the user might use checked arithmetics between the try/catch, which assumes it get caught by \"catch\"\r\n\r\n## Suggested fix\r\n\r\n- At a minimum, the return value decoding should not revert  in a try/catch block. otherwise, try/catch can't be trusted when calling unknown contracts, and developers must resort to low-level `address.call(abi.encodeWithSelector(...))` (and manually validate the returned structure before decoding)\r\n\r\nIn addition, the try/catch model should be updated:\r\n- in case a user specifies a `catch {}` block, it is his expectation that no revert will leak from the \"try\" block.\r\n- The entire code after the \"try\" until the \"catch\" should be \"no-revert\" - must not generate revert by the compiler itself.\r\n- Instead of reverting, this code should jump to the `catch {}` block \r\n- Implementing a full \"stack unwinding\" for revert handling seems unlikely for solidity, so instead I suggest:\r\n   - when compiling methods, mark each method as \"may-revert\" or \"no-revert\"\r\n   - Is case the try/catch block calls \"may-revert\" method,  a compilation error should be generated: `cannot call method X from a try/catch block: the method might revert`\r\n  - the user should then alter his code and call that method outside the try/catch block, or add \"unchecked\" markers to that method\r\n\r\n",
