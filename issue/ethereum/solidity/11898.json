  "body": "## Description\r\n\r\nSolidity generates slightly different source maps when:\r\n\r\n1. The contract is not imported by any other contract in the code base.\r\n2. The exact same contract is imported by other contract in the code base, which is compiled as well.\r\n\r\nIn the second case, there is an extra semicolon in the source maps. As per the [docs](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.7/internals/source_mappings.html), this *should* refer to an additional assembly instruction in the contract. But there is no such instruction, thus this may be a bug. I expected the source maps to be identical between the two circumstances, given that all else is equal (compiler settings, source code, whitespaces, etc).\r\n\r\nHere are two GitHub Gists with the different source maps:\r\n\r\n- [1st case](https://gist.github.com/paulrberg/b250fbb6d5aa92ae27381071aa1a8e61)\r\n- [2nd case](https://gist.github.com/paulrberg/7f70bf4415d7ffd51645507fbba63e93)\r\n\r\nIf you run these on [text-compare.com](https://text-compare.com), you will notice that there are more diffs than just an extra semicolon. But you can ignore all of them, except the semicolon, because they refer to the different file ids that get assigned to `PRBProxy` and `#utility.yul` by Solidity. Check out characters 317-320th; in the 1st case, you find `4;;;2`, and in the 2nd case `8;;;;`.\r\n\r\n## Environment\r\n\r\n- Compiler version: solc-macosx-amd64-v0.8.7+commit.e28d00a7\r\n- Target EVM version (as per compiler settings): Compiler default (London)\r\n- Framework/IDE (e.g. Truffle or Remix): Hardhat\r\n- EVM execution environment / backend / blockchain client: Hardhat Network (hardhat@2.6.2)\r\n- Operating system: macOS@11.5.2\r\n\r\n## Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n1. Git clone [prb-proxy](https://github.com/paulrberg/prb-proxy/commit/93d337b3fa66fe03ccf3e355b5da490bf5bba273) at commit `93d337b` \r\n2. Install dependencies with `yarn install`\r\n3. Fill a `.env` file as shown by the `.env.example` file\r\n4. Generate the TypeChain bindings with `yarn typechain`\r\n5. Run the tests with `yarn test --verbose`\r\n\r\nYou should get the following error:\r\n\r\n```\r\n  hardhat:core:hardhat-network:node Could not generate stack trace. Please report this to help us improve Hardhat.\r\n  hardhat:core:hardhat-network:node  Error: This shouldn't happen: a call trace has no functionJumpdest but has already jumped into a function\r\n    at ErrorInferrer._getEntryBeforeFailureInModifier (/Users/paulrberg/workspace/pad/prb-proxy-clone/node_modules/hardhat/src/internal/hardhat-network/stack-traces/error-inferrer.ts:1476:13)\r\n    at ErrorInferrer._checkRevertOrInvalidOpcode (/Users/paulrberg/workspace/pad/prb-proxy-clone/node_modules/hardhat/src/internal/hardhat-network/stack-traces/error-inferrer.ts:370:16)\r\n    at ErrorInferrer._checkLastInstruction (/Users/paulrberg/workspace/pad/prb-proxy-clone/node_modules/hardhat/src/internal/hardhat-network/stack-traces/error-inferrer.ts:554:44)\r\n    at ErrorInferrer.inferAfterTracing (/Users/paulrberg/workspace/pad/prb-proxy-clone/node_modules/hardhat/src/internal/hardhat-network/stack-traces/error-inferrer.ts:162:12)\r\n    at SolidityTracer._rawTraceEvmExecution (/Users/paulrberg/workspace/pad/prb-proxy-clone/node_modules/hardhat/src/internal/hardhat-network/stack-traces/solidityTracer.ts:211:61)\r\n    at SolidityTracer._traceEvmExecution (/Users/paulrberg/workspace/pad/prb-proxy-clone/node_modules/hardhat/src/internal/hardhat-network/stack-traces/solidityTracer.ts:149:29)\r\n    at SolidityTracer._getCallMessageStackTrace (/Users/paulrberg/workspace/pad/prb-proxy-clone/node_modules/hardhat/src/internal/hardhat-network/stack-traces/solidityTracer.ts:72:17)\r\n    at SolidityTracer.getStackTrace (/Users/paulrberg/workspace/pad/prb-proxy-clone/node_modules/hardhat/src/internal/hardhat-network/stack-traces/solidityTracer.ts:56:19)\r\n    at HardhatNode._manageErrors (/Users/paulrberg/workspace/pad/prb-proxy-clone/node_modules/hardhat/src/internal/hardhat-network/provider/node.ts:1705:41)\r\n    at HardhatNode.estimateGas (/Users/paulrberg/workspace/pad/prb-proxy-clone/node_modules/hardhat/src/internal/hardhat-network/provider/node.ts:661:27)\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Implications\r\n\r\nThis is likely what causes https://github.com/nomiclabs/hardhat/issues/1185. The error above is the same as the one reported by everyone else there.\r\n\r\n## More Details\r\n\r\nI spent three days debugging this. What I know thus far:\r\n\r\n- The issue goes away when I manually remove the extra semicolon the source maps\r\n- The issue goes away when I delete the `PRBProxyFactory.sol` and `PRBProxyRegistry.sol` contracts and compile just `PRBProxy.sol` and its dependencies\r\n- The issue goes away when I rename the `execute` function to something else, such as `fooBarBaz`\r\n- The issue goes away when I turn off the compiler optimizer\r\n- Seems this has something to do with the modifier (`onlyOwnable`) and the `JUMPTDEST` opcode",

    "body": "Cc-ing @alcuadrado and @fvictorio, they might be able to help. I tracked the error in the Hardhat source code. This is what I found:\r\n\r\n1. [Line 1477](https://github.com/nomiclabs/hardhat/blob/deaa288a44f133204392464c7a9257b56c99f4df/packages/hardhat-core/src/internal/hardhat-network/stack-traces/error-inferrer.ts#L1477) in `stack-traces.ts` gets executed because `functionJumpdests` is empty.\r\n2. `functionJumpdests` is empty because [line 191](https://github.com/nomiclabs/hardhat/blob/deaa288a44f133204392464c7a9257b56c99f4df/packages/hardhat-core/src/internal/hardhat-network/stack-traces/solidityTracer.ts#L191) gets executed in `solidityTracer.ts`. I suspect that this is correct, the issue being the flawed source maps.\r\n\r\nI also looked at [source-maps.ts](https://github.com/nomiclabs/hardhat/blob/deaa288a44f133204392464c7a9257b56c99f4df/packages/hardhat-core/src/internal/hardhat-network/stack-traces/source-maps.ts) but nothing caught my attention, except for https://github.com/nomiclabs/hardhat/pull/1857. But even after fixing the `hasPart3` line, the tests kept failing. Thus I conjectured that this may be a bug in Solidity .. and I went down the rabbit hole and ended up opening this issue.",

    "body": "> Can you please provide the assembly and the bytecode output of both ways to compile the contract?\r\n\r\nI updated the GitHub Gists I shared in the first post:\r\n\r\n1. [src-maps-bug-1st-case.json ](https://gist.github.com/paulrberg/b250fbb6d5aa92ae27381071aa1a8e61)\r\n2. [src-maps-bug-2nd-case.json](https://gist.github.com/paulrberg/7f70bf4415d7ffd51645507fbba63e93)\r\n\r\nThey are JSONs which with `deployedBytecode`, `opcodes` and `sourceMaps` entries.\r\n\r\n> And could you please also provide the sources and the metadata file, so I can try to reproduce it locally?\r\n\r\nThe sources are in the [prb-proxy](https://github.com/paulrberg/prb-proxy) repository, at commit [93d337b](https://github.com/paulrberg/prb-proxy/commit/93d337b3fa66fe03ccf3e355b5da490bf5bba273). To reproduce the 1st case results, run Hardhat over the repo as is. You have instructions in the first post; the specific command is `yarn compile`. To reproduce the 2nd case results, delete the `PRBProxyFactory.sol`, `IPRBProxyFactory.sol`, `PRBProxyRegistry.sol` and `IPRBProxyRegistry.sol` files, and run Hardhat again.\r\n\r\nIn the 1st case, the name of the file under `artifacts/build-info` should be `313bad6d3bea2ff85dd80179204ba658.json`. In the 2nd, it should be `e0c925ee78a287a14868de7d4f5c3c00.json`.\r\n\r\nRegarding the \"metadata file\", I have no such thing. All the compiler settings are defined in [hardhat.config.ts](https://github.com/paulrberg/prb-proxy/blob/93d337b3fa66fe03ccf3e355b5da490bf5bba273/hardhat.config.ts). For what it's worth, I [disabled](https://github.com/paulrberg/prb-proxy/blob/93d337b3fa66fe03ccf3e355b5da490bf5bba273/hardhat.config.ts#L75) the metadata hash.",
