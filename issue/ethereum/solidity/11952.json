  "body": "Interfaces only allow defining external functions. This means that if `I` is an interface, one can expect `I(addr).functionCall()` to correspond to an external function call. However, `using for` breaks this by allowing one to bind an internal function to interfaces. One typical example is the following:\r\n\r\n```solidity\r\n/// From OZ\r\nlibrary SafeERC20 {\r\n    function safeTransferFrom(\r\n        IERC20 token,\r\n        address from,\r\n        address to,\r\n        uint256 value\r\n    ) internal {\r\n        _callOptionalReturn(token, abi.encodeWithSelector(token.transferFrom.selector, from, to, value));\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\nusing SafeERC20 for IERC20;\r\n\r\nIERC20(_token).safeTransferFrom(...);\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis pattern decreases readability of contracts (because it's obvious that `safeTransferFrom` is not in the ERC20 standard and this makes it look like an incorrect interface implementation) and unfortunately is very prevalant: [list of etherscan verified contracts with with this behaviour](https://sourcegraph.com/search?q=context:global+repo:%5Egithub%5C.com/tintinweb/smart-contract-sanctuary+lang:Solidity+content:%22I*%5C%5C%28*%5C%5C%29%5C%5C.safeTransferFrom%22++&patternType=regexp&case=yes). \r\n\r\nYou can make this even worse by defining an external library function and making `I(addr).functionCall()` to be a `delegatecall` instead of `call`.\r\n\r\nA controversial suggestion to fix this is to disallow `using for` for interfaces. However, I think this might be impractical citing the widespread usage.",

    "body": "If it made its way into OpenZeppelin then it might be a bit too late for disallowing this. `SafeERC20` seems to have been introduced in 2017 (https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/pull/413, around the time of Solidity 0.4.11). The fact that it's still there and even has a comment suggesting `using SafeERC20 for IERC20` indicates that at least OZ team embraces it as a pattern as worth supporting. We should at least discuss this with them. Maybe opening a topic on the OZ forum to gather some feedback would be a good idea?\r\n\r\nI think that one reason for this pattern is convenience - repeating the library name makes the statement longer - so maybe replacing it with a free function would be a viable alternative.\r\n\r\nAnother might be that users are often familiar with other interfaces that do have `safeTransferFrom()` and using this method on also on `IERC20` may seem natural to them. This one might be a harder sell as a free function. On the other hand I'm not sure if this similarity is actually a good thing. After all `SafeERC20.safeTransferFrom()` makes the call is \"safe\" in a different sense than e.g. `IERC721.safeTransferFrom()` does. So this pattern probably steers less experienced users towards these alternative functions but on the other hand might muddle things up for more experienced users.",
