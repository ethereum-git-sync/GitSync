  "body": "User defined value types currently only allow constructions via the `UserDefineType.wrap(...)` function call. This can be rather verbose, especially when we allow operators on the type.\r\n\r\n\r\n```solidity\r\ntype MyInt is int;\r\nMyInt x;\r\nx + MyInt.wrap(5);\r\n// v/s\r\nx + MyInt(1);\r\n// v/s more controversial implicit literal conversion\r\nx + 1;\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Proposal**: for a user defined type `Type T is V;` allow the syntax `T(<type V>)` to construct an element. This is in line with the same syntax for built-in types as well as for structs.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nA second problem with `.wrap` and `.unwrap` is the lack of *type-encapsulation*. As long as the type `MyInt` is visible in the context, so are the functions `MyInt.wrap` and `MyInt.unwrap`. This makes compiler enforced type-encapsulation impossible, currently.\r\n\r\nOne way to solve this is allowing the constructor only in the same source unit as the type declaration.\r\n```solidity\r\n==== Source: A ====\r\ntype MyInt is int;\r\n==== Source: B ====\r\nimport {MyInt} from \"A\";\r\n// this would be a compile error as the constructor is not 'public'\r\nMyInt(1);\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is also how rust solves it: see section [Problem 1](https://www.worthe-it.co.za/blog/2020-10-31-newtype-pattern-in-rust.html).\r\n\r\n(As @ekpyron pointed out, encapsulation isn't an issue exclusively with `.wrap` and `.unwrap`--we can enforce the same rules to `.wrap` and `.unwrap`.)\r\n\r\nAs a side proposal: perhaps it is worthwhile to allow `type MyInt is public int;` which would expose the `MyInt(...)` constructor in other source units. However, this can be done separately in the future.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n*Issues*\r\n\r\nThe proposed syntax looks quite similar to conversions. This may be confusing. For example, in  `type Fixed18 is int;`, a user may confuse `Fixed18(1)` to mean `Fixed18.wrap(10**18)`. Encapsulation may be a solution for this. Where a fixed point library can implement it as follows:\r\n```solidity\r\n==== Source: FixedMath ====\r\ntype Fixed18 is int;\r\nfunction toFixed18(int x) pure returns (Fixed18) { return Fixed18(x * 10**18); }\r\n==== Source: B ====\r\nimport {Fixed18, toFixed} from \"A\";\r\n// only toFixed18() is accessible here.\r\n// Fixed18(5) would not typecheck here\r\n```\r\n\r\nOther issues (raised by @ekpyron and @chriseth):\r\n- The construction syntax is unnamed, and this only works if there is clearly one way to do it.\r\n- Looking at `MyInt(5)` only as construction, rather than conversion, might require changing all the existing conversions. Relevant: https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/11284.\r\n- Potential issues with generics in the future.\r\n",

    "body": "Encapsulation works just as well with `wrap` and `unwrap`. We can just remove them from the type outside of whatever scope this should be restricted to - but still have defined explicit conversions.\r\nSo this really doesn't have anything to do with wrap/unwrap vs conversion syntax.\r\n\r\nAnd as you say: as long as ``MyInt(...)`` is our conversion syntax for other types, we should also treat it as conversions and not as construction for user-defined types, otherwise things become inconsistent and confusing.\r\nOnce we have different conversions I'd be very happy to use ``MyInt(...)``as construction - however, what you haven't talked about at all is destruction - how do you imagine that to work? Is pattern matching another requirement for this change or do you have a different solution?",
