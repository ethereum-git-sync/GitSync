  "body": "In  #11583 we made `--pretty-print` affect Standard JSON and also added the `--json-indent` option. There are still some command-line options that ignore these:\r\n- `--asm-json`\r\n- `--ast-compact-json`\r\n- `--abi`\r\n- `--userdoc`\r\n- `--devdoc`\r\n- `--storage-layout`\r\n- `--metadata`\r\n\r\nSome of them always pretty-print the JSON but with hard-coded indent size, some do not pretty-print at all. Change them all so that by default the JSON output is compact and changes when `--pretty-print`/`json-indent` is used.\r\n\r\nWe might want to exempt `--metadata` from this since we embed its hash in the bytecode and a pretty-printed version would not match it. But maybe that's ok - it's meant to be reproducible and being able to easily inspect it is also important. And in any case `--combined-json metadata` does get affected by `--pretty-print` so we already have this problem.\r\n\r\nAfter changing it, we'll need to add pretty printing options to command-line tests to keep them readable. Alternatively, we could implement #7665 first.\r\n\r\n## Backwards Compatibility\r\nI don't think that we guarantee stable JSON formatting between versions so I'd say this is not breaking.\r\n\r\nChanging the formatting for `--metadata` might affect tools that hash its output but also use `--pretty-json` to get nice output from `--combined-json` at the same time. I think it's a pretty obscure case though.",
