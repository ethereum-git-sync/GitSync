    "body": "Do you mean distributing the `solc` executable via conan? It's an interesting idea, though I'm not sure using conan this way actually solves any practical problem. Getting the compiler is already as simple as downloading a statically linked binary from https://binaries.soliditylang.org so this would not simplify anything unless you're already using conan and even then it's not that much of a simplification. The compiler is most often used indirectly, via frameworks like Truffle, Hardhat, Brownie, dapp-tools, etc and they already have built-in mechanisms for downloading the binaries and managing different versions. I doubt they would be switching to getting it via conan.\r\n\r\nThis would be much more useful if we had `libsolc` as proposed in #5306 but there has not been too much progress on that. Once we do have it though, I agree that conan would be a good option to distribute the library in a way that makes it easy to use in other C++ projects. The question is though - why specifically conan and not e.g. [Hunter](https://hunter.readthedocs.io) or [vcpkg](https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg)?\r\n\r\nFinally, a prerequisite to distribute via conan would probably be to make it possible for the compiler to use dependencies from there so we should do that first. I think this would actually be a good way to solve #8860.",
