    "body": "Some relevant discussion from the chat:\r\n\r\n@hrkrshnn \r\n> A random idea: about this: https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/12127. I think we should do it, a rough calculation is that a precompile staticcall should cost  about the same in case of  copying 2 words and get cheaper for more than 2 words.\r\n> \r\n> Related to that, we should probably add a new built-in to Yul called `memcopy(in, insize, out)` that gets translated to `staticcall(gas(), 4, in, insize, out, insize)`. I think having a specific built-in in Yul should help us easily reason about redundant memory copies.\r\n\r\n@cameel\r\n> Regarding a new builtin - I'm not sure if it would help all that much, at least with the upcoming optimization steps.\r\n> [RedundantStoreEliminator](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/11352) can already deal with memory read and written by `staticcall()` just as if it was a pair of `mload()`/`mstore()` and it does not really care about the content being read/written.\r\n> [EqualStoreEliminator](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/12272) on the other hand only deals with simple single-slot store operations.\r\n>\r\n> Oh, one thing it might help with is that currently for `staticcall` we have to assume that arbitrary storage reads are possible during the call. So using it for memory copy in between two overlapping stores would prevent `RedundantStoreEliminator` from removing the redundant one.\r\nI guess that with the builtin we could just assume that the precompile does not read or write any storage?\r\n\r\n@hrkrshnn \r\n> Yeah, there are two things here. Loops are hard to work with. So if we can replace a for loop doing `mstore` by `memcopy`, analysis becomes easier. The other thing as you said is if you replace the loop by `staticcal(gas(), 4, ...)`, we'll need to start modelling `staticall` opcode's side-effects based on the address it calls.",
