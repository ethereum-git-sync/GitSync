It would be great if you could confirm this. I have a feeling this is because of a missed optimization opportunity (see https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/12088).\r\n\r\n> You can verify this by deploying the contract and then using a getStorageAt call.\r\n\r\nAh nice! Is it easy to onboard to infura for deploying/running compared to Remix? The reason I ask is that I've not used Infura and find Remix easy as a noob. But ofcourse if it's worth the effort, I wouldn't mind spending time on other platforms :-)\r\n\r\n",
