    "body": "I want to actually suggest *not* doing this.  Or at least, adding a way to turn off such a thing.  (This is obviously based on my point of view of working at Truffle and having worked on the code that interfaces with the compiler.)\r\n\r\nThe fact that the Solidity compiler *doesn't* validate `outputSelection` makes it really easy to write code that works with multiple versions at once.  You know the particular output you want, you ask for it, and if you don't get it due to an old version, well, you don't get it due to an old version.\r\n\r\nLet's suppose instead that asking for an unknown form of output caused an error -- the Vyper compiler does this, and, well, it's a pain!  It means, when compiling Vyper, we have to check the compiler version, look up what particular forms of output that version supports, and make sure to only ask for those particular things.\r\n\r\nEvery single form of output that Solidity adds after this change is made would have to be accompanied by an appropriate version check.  Right now, our code for interfacing with the Solidity compiler actually doesn't know about the version, anywhere!  So if 0.8.10 adds output selection validation, and later 0.9.0 adds a new form of output that we want to get, well... it's going to make a mess.\r\n\r\nNow the advantages of making this change are obvious; most people really *don't* want silent failure on bad `outputSelection`, we're probably a little unusual in actually wanting that.  But, well, that is something we rely on, so I have to point out that this change does have substantial disadvantages as well.  Maybe as a compromise there could be some sort of option one could pass somewhere to indicate, hey, don't validate the output selection, or something...?  (Note that the option would have to be passed somewhere such that older versions would ignore it, rather than erroring due to an unexpected option.)",

    "body": "> Honestly I'm a bit surprised that other options in Standard JSON do not already cause this problem but maybe that's because a lot of them are dictionaries and there stray keys might not be always rejected?\r\n\r\nGood question. :)  The actual answer is there output selection is the only setting that we routinely set ourselves!  The other settings are left to the user, so, if they put in settings that the particular version they're using doesn't recognize... well, that's not our fault. :)\r\n\r\n(In `truffle test`, we *do* in certain conditions set `settings.debug.revertStrings`, and we *do* have to put a version check around that, which is annoying.  (And we might want to look on turning on further debug settings once 0.8.10 comes out, which would entail a further version check...)  But that's a separate area of the code, not part of the code that interfaces directly with the compiler, so it can do those version checks; it's actually putting the setting into a Truffle config rather than directly into the standard JSON. :P )\r\n\r\n> A solution with a flag that disables stricter validation behavior on demand sounds fine to me.

It is a bit hacky but not overly so. We already support some special values like `*`. So e.g. we could make the compiler disable validation if you include `?` as one of the items. Or maybe something like `_ignore-invalid-values` if we want it to be more self-explanatory.\r\n\r\nAnother idea would be to allow appending/prepending `?` to values to make the compiler skip them if they are invalid. Unfortunately this would not work with older compilers (they would ignore them when invalid but you would not get the output if they're valid) so yours sounds more viable.",

These are completely static for a given compiler. They can change between versions though.\r\n\r\nTo summarize my discussion with @haltman-at above:\r\n- Using `[\"xyz\", \"evm.metadata\", \"ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ\", \"\"]` would be a validation error.\r\n- There would be a special value you could insert into the array to make the compiler not validate it. For example `?` so that `[\"?\", \"xyz\", \"evm.metadata\", \"ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ\", \"\"]` would not be a validation error.\r\n\r\n@Marenz \r\n> Couldn't you keep that approach and just ignore/accept/display the error? You'd have the same behavior?\r\n\r\nNot sure what you mean. If the compiler reports an error the compilation stops and ignoring it leaves Truffle without a compiled contract.",

Not validating stuff might be useful for tools if they request it but I think that by default validations should be there.",
