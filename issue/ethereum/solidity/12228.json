  "body": "`solc-js` throws a massive error on unhandled promise rejections. Here's a simple script you can use to reproduce:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nconst solc = require('solc')\r\n\r\nconst main = async () => {\r\n  throw new Error('asdf')\r\n}\r\n\r\nmain()\r\n```\r\n\r\nRunning this script will dump entire source of `soljson.js` to your terminal. `soljson.js` throws the following `RuntimeError`:\r\n\r\n```\r\nRuntimeError: abort(Error: asdf). Build with -s ASSERTIONS=1 for more info.\r\n    at process.abort (/home/k/Projects/work/random/solcjs-test/node_modules/solc/soljson.js:1:13012\r\n```\r\n\r\nNodeJS wants to show you the line on which the error was triggered but `soljson.js` is a minified file where the entire source is on a single line. As a result, it prints out the entire source of `soljson.js`. Upon cleaning up the file with `js-beautify` I no longer get the entire source dumped and get the following useful error:\r\n\r\n```\r\nk@kpc:~/Projects/work/random/solcjs-test$ node index.js \r\nError: asdf\r\n/home/k/Projects/work/random/solcjs-test/node_modules/solc/soljson.js:622\r\n    throw e\r\n    ^\r\n\r\nRuntimeError: abort(Error: asdf). Build with -s ASSERTIONS=1 for more info.\r\n    at process.abort (/home/k/Projects/work/random/solcjs-test/node_modules/solc/soljson.js:621:13)\r\n    at process.emit (events.js:400:28)\r\n    at processPromiseRejections (internal/process/promises.js:245:33)\r\n    at processTicksAndRejections (internal/process/task_queues.js:96:32)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis error comes from the following function inside of `soljson.js`:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nfunction abort(what) {\r\n    if (Module[\"onAbort\"]) {\r\n        Module[\"onAbort\"](what)\r\n    }\r\n    what += \"\";\r\n    err(what);\r\n    ABORT = true;\r\n    EXITSTATUS = 1;\r\n    what = \"abort(\" + what + \"). Build with -s ASSERTIONS=1 for more info.\";\r\n    var e = new WebAssembly.RuntimeError(what);\r\n    throw e\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhich is triggered because of this listener:\r\n\r\n```js\r\n    process[\"on\"](\"unhandledRejection\", abort);\r\n```\r\n\r\nI've found various workarounds to this problem. One relatively easy workaround is to remove the listener:\r\n\r\n```\r\nconst listeners = process.listeners('unhandledRejection')\r\nprocess.removeListener('unhandledRejection', listeners[listeners.length - 1])\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, it would be great to have a canonical fix to this problem.",

    "body": "This seems to be an issue with emscripten and the binary it builds, not `solc-js`. I see that emscripten added the `NODEJS_CATCH_REJECTION` flag (https://github.com/emscripten-core/emscripten/pull/9061) as a workaround. Maybe we should start using it when building but looks like there are some downsides. From https://github.com/haberbyte/emscripten/commit/bc370fed4dddfb705e71bd0ab719aa24e990252f:\r\n\r\n> * Add NODEJS_CATCH_REJECTION, a flag that allows disabling the catching of unhandled rejections in node. This is useful if a dev doesn't want it to interfere with their own code. We don't set this to 0 by default because it would mean some wasm errors end up not returning a non-zero return code from node (still true as of 12.4.0)\r\n\r\nSo if we do this, we might have to at least bump the minimum node.js requirement. We might also need https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/11689 - we're on emscripten 2.0.12 now, released in January and the flag seems to have been added just after that release (changelog does not mention it though).\r\n\r\n> NodeJS wants to show you the line on which the error was triggered but soljson.js is a minified file where the entire source is on a single line. As a result, it prints out the entire source of soljson.js.\r\n\r\nRight, this is very annoying. We seem to have some workarounds for it because I'm not seeing it as much in newer versions of solc-js and the compiler but when it does happen the output just obscures everything.\r\n\r\n@ekpyron maybe we could use the [`--minify=0`](https://emscripten.org/docs/tools_reference/emcc.html#emcc-minify) with emscripten? The JS part in the binaries does not seem to be particularly big so I don't think it would add that much to the size and anyone who cares about size should compress them anyway (the binary part is very compressible).",

    "body": "Yeah, it's technically a duplicate but this one had better description. I'd close the other one but I thought it being open in solc-js might help people who have this issue find the workaround. I'd be fine with just closing it though.\r\n\r\n> So we had this issue before, didn't we? And we added some workarounds that look similar to the last one suggested in the description.\r\n\r\nWe did - https://github.com/ethereum/solc-js/issues/505 was reported in December 2020 - but I don't think we did anything in response to that. I can reproduce the problem on 0.8.9 which means it has no workaround.",
