If we allow loading *something* from calldata, we effectively allow loading *anything* from calldata and thus might as well keep ``msg.data`` pure...\r\nThen again, I'm not sure if we should ever even try to actually compile-time-evaluate inline assembly anyways...\r\n\r\nSo maybe restricting ``pure`` to the notion of \"external pure\" only is enough (i.e. disallow accessing code, but generally allowing to access calldata however one likes, including via msg.data) - and whether an internal pure function can be compile-time evaluated we can have the compiler decide without a special syntactic marker... but I'm not sure...",
