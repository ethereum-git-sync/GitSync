You can already use the compiler on M1 this way with e.g. Hardhat or Truffle.",

I will post an update once I have a timeline available to share!\r\n> We are also looking into ways to support this new hardware in our non-dedicated host solution, though we're still researching this and are unable to provide any concrete details at this time.\r\n\r\nThis is probably because [AWS started offering M1 recently](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2021/12/amazon-ec2-m1-mac-instances-macos/). The \"dedicated host\" option AFAIK means using the [VM service](https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/vm-service/) which basically runs CI on your own Amazon AWS account rather than on CircleCI infrastructure. That looks like a lot of hassle compared to our current setup but should be doable once they release it. Not sure if we want to get into that though.\r\n\r\nGithub [did make Big Sur generally available](https://github.blog/changelog/2021-08-16-github-actions-macos-11-big-sur-is-generally-available-on-github-hosted-runners/) in August but there's no mention of M1 so I'm assuming that's still all on x86.",
