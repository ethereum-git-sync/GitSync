  "body": "Currently we run all CI jobs on all PRs. CircleCI has recently introduced the [dynamic configuration](https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/dynamic-config/) feature which allows us to select different sets of CI jobs depending on various criteria like e.g. modified paths. We can use this to make CI finish faster (and use less credits) on documentation PRs.\r\n\r\nAdd a new workflow to [`.circleci/config.yml`](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/develop/.circleci/config.yml) called `docs`. The workflow should be triggered when changes are made only to files inside `docs/` and/or text files at the root of the repository. The workflow should include only the following jobs:\r\n- `b_docs`\r\n- `chk_spelling`\r\n- `chk_docs_examples`\r\n- `chk_coding_style`\r\n- `chk_pylint`\r\n- `chk_antlr_grammar`\r\n- `chk_buglist`\r\n- `chk_docs_pragma_min_version`\r\n- `t_ubu_pyscripts`\r\n- `t_win_pyscripts`\r\n\r\nThe last two are not strictly necessary right now but they're are very light and we do have some python stuff inside `docs/` and we might start testing at some point in the future.\r\n\r\nThis approach has one downside - we won't be running command-line tests and a part of that is a check that all the examples in the docs do compile using the current build of the compiler. I think that his is a reasonable trade-off and any problems in the docs that would fail this check will soon be discovered anyway during the next full run. If we don't want to make that trade-off we can also make the new workflow include a build for one platform and a limited run of command-line tests.\r\n\r\nWe can limit the impact of the above by always running the main workflow on `develop`. So even if problems are not detected in the PR, they'll be caught immediately after it's merged.",

Looking at the script, it can use local `solc-$version` if that's just lying around and `$version` can be the dev version returned by `get_version.sh` but why would the binary be named like that?
