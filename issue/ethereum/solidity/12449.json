We ask only that you do your best to provide as much information as possible so we can better help you.\r\n- Support questions are better asked in one of the following locations:\r\n    - [Solidity chat](https://gitter.im/ethereum/solidity)\r\n    - [Stack Overflow](https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/)\r\n- Ensure the issue isn't already reported (check `feature` and `language design` labels).\r\n\r\n*Delete the above section and the instructions in the sections below before submitting*\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## Abstract\r\n\r\n```\r\nCompiling 106 files with 0.8.11\r\nCompilerError: Stack too deep when compiling inline assembly: Variable dataEnd is 1 slot(s) too deep inside the stack.\r\n```\r\n\r\nCompilerError does not mention the location where the problem is (or at least any hints where the problem could be).\r\n\r\n<!--Please describe by example what problem you see in the current Solidity language and reason about it.-->\r\n\r\n## Motivation\r\n\r\nI have a huge project, removed a parameter from a bunch of functions now the project doesn't compile and not sure where to look.\r\n\r\n<!--In this section you describe how you propose to address the problem you described earlier, including by giving one or more exemplary source code snippets for demonstration.-->\r\n\r\n## Specification\r\n\r\nIf it tells which file / function causes this issue, or any hints it would be helpful.\r\n\r\n<!--The technical specification should describe the syntax and semantics of any new feature. The specification should be detailed enough to allow any developer to implement the functionality.-->\r\n\r\n## Backwards Compatibility\r\n\r\nNone\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nAll language changes that introduce backwards incompatibilities must include a section describing these incompatibilities and their severity.\r\n\r\nPlease describe how you propose to deal with these incompatibilities.\r\n-->\r\n",
