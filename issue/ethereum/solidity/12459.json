  "body": "## Abstract\r\n\r\nUsing compiler option \"runs\" allows for bytecode optimization, but sometimes optimization expands smart contract bytecode that much it will not fit into EIP-171 (24KB). As far as I understand setting \"runs=1\" allows bytecode size optimization for deployment. Is there any way to have an additional argument for making optimizer aware of deployment limitation?\r\n\r\n## Motivation\r\n\r\nWant to optimize smart contract for execution and still be able to fit in 24KB.\r\n\r\n## Specification\r\n\r\nLet's introduce new parameter \"smartContractBytecodeDeploymentLimit\" or something like this. The optimizer could somehow reduce inlinings when the limit is exceeded.\r\n\r\n## Backwards Compatibility\r\n\r\nCan use 1 billion of gas as a default value to have almost unreachable backward compatibility.\r\n",
