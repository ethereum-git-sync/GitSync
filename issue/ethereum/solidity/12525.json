My simplistic mental model (not being aware of how the implementation works), is that named return variables work as if they add an implicit `return (namedVar1, namedVar2);` that I don't need to write myself (e.g. if there are multiple `if` branches in the method). However, in reality, in case of shadowing, the explicit `return (namedVar1, namedVar2);` returns local variables, but the implicit `return (namedVar1, namedVar2);` returns signature variables. \r\n\r\nThe danger is in a large enough project with already existing compiler warnings that are disregarded (for various reasons). A new warning might be easily missed by someone working on a particular scoped change, and the reviewer of that code might miss the shadowing, or have the wrong mental model about it, thinking that it should work.",
