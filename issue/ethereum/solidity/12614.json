    "body": "Right, thanks, I had not paid attention to constructors when merging https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/12569...\r\nLooking at the examples, I also realize that we don't specify a place for ``error`` declarations - and whatever we'd specify, the ``safe-remote.rst`` example would violate it :-)... and it already violates the event-modifier ordering... and it has the constructor *after* the modifiers... hm...\r\n\r\nAlso the part about \"contract elements\" should probably be renamed to \"file-level elements\" these days and would need to account for the new file-level elements like free functions and file-level error declarations...\r\n\r\nSince the \"Order of Functions\" section considers the constructor a function, it would be \"easier\" to just move the constructor down in the examples... however, visually I personally find it more appealing to have it before :-)... EDIT: then again you can apply modifiers to constructors...\r\n\r\nI'll ping our channel for more opinions!",

    "body": "Decision from the call: we're fine handing over maintenance of the style guide to @fulldecent but we prefer the guide to stay in the main repo / main docs. At least unless it turns out it's not working out well for some reason. We're on board with the rest of the roadmap.\r\n\r\nWe're going to add @fulldecent to [CODEOWNERS](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/about-code-owners) to give him direct access to the guide. This needs to be done by someone with owner or admin access to the repo (@chriseth, @axic).\r\n\r\nBTW, since the discussion about maintenance basically took over this issue, I'm adjusting the title to reflect that.",
