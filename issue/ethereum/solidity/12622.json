    "body": "But even in this example, I'd actually agree with @chriseth - since ``IMarket`` defines the interface function as taking ``IERC20``, every implementation will have to allow for the possibility that ``someAction`` is called with an arbitrary ``IERC20`` token... that's pretty much the promise you give by implementing ``IMarket`` - if my implementation of ``someAction`` will break for anything that's not a ``IExtendedERC20`` token, then it's not really a valid implementation of ``IMarket.someAction``...\r\nOr was this just brevity in the example and you mean something like this?\r\n```solidity\r\nfunction someAction(IERC20_and_IERC165 token, uint256 amount) external {\r\n  if (token.supportsInterface(type(IExtendedERC20).interfaceId)) {\r\n      IExtendedERC20(address(token)).extendedMethod();\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nThat's a case in which I guess such a cast would be valid, but since without some additional hoops like this, this is actually dangerous, maybe it's not so bad that this requires a verbose cast in the end...\r\n\r\nThe danger in a direct explicit cast is that it might suggest that there is actually some kind of type-checking happening there and you might easily be tricked into expecting that the cast reverts if the type doesn't actually match - but that's not the case...",

    "body": "Well, we know that the current conversion syntax is limiting so I think it's better to do the opposite - first figure out how to fix it. It then makes implementing some features on top of it easy (like downcasting or casting function types). I think that's better than trying to shoehorn it into the current system.\r\n\r\nAbout not having an agreement yet - true. My position is that I see some value in it but I don't think that it's a game changer. Downcast is still a dangerous operation that the compiler cannot fully verify. IMO a downcast syntax would be a slight improvement over a cast to `address` but it also has to be weighed against making the language more complex.\r\n",

    "body": "I wanted to say any casting, including to a \"bad\" contract, because the difference between this and downcasting is not that big to me. Both are inherently unsafe. With downcasting there's one extra check that can catch one specific class off errors but you can still cast to a type not actually supported by the contract.\r\n\r\nBut, thinking more about it, for example integer conversions mentioned by @frangio don't let you do absolutely anything. For example you have to change sign and width in two separate steps. So in that sense being able to only downcast directly and having to go through `address` to cast to other contract types would not be inconsistent with the rest of the language.\r\n\r\nBasically, you convinced me that having `A(b)` do an unsafe conversion would be fine. Whether we should require that unsafe conversion to only be a downcast or if we should allow anything - either one makes sense in some way. I'd like to hear what others think on this point.",

If I want to make sure this is not happening I will just avoid using `A(address(b))` ever - this will let me believe I have only implicit upcasts and explicit downcasts.",
