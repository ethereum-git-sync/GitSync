I believe code could be more expressive with this feature.\r\n\r\n## Specification\r\n\r\nTuple could be called anonymous struct, with both name and field names anonymous. We could use indexes to have access to individual fields:\r\n\r\n```solidity\r\nfunction foo() public view returns(uint256 value, bytes memory data) { ... }\r\n\r\nfoo().0\r\nfoo().1\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Backwards Compatibility\r\n\r\nNot sure there is any way to make this backward compatible.\r\n",

    "body": "> array brackets makes me think elements are of the same type, which is not true.\r\n\r\nI think it depends on what each of us is used to. To me the `.0` syntax feels a bit like I'm abusing some internal mechanism that exposes element indexes as properties on an object. It just looks weird. On the other hand, having used Python a lot, using brackets to index tuples feels completely natural and intuitive.\r\n\r\nIn any case, I agree that it would be nice to have tuples as proper types or at least some way to access elements, whatever syntax we might eventually settle on.",
