  "body": "Today I spent some time on prototyping and was managed to achieve O(1)-complexity dispatcher. Check out few my messages here: https://github.com/vyperlang/vyper/issues/2386#issuecomment-1033117651\r\n\r\nAnd find code prototype here: https://gist.github.com/k06a/737fd1f389bb6f2e66f0ef76ea73729b\r\n\r\n## Abstract\r\n\r\nI believe dispatcher implementation initially was O(N), but now it may be tree-like O(log(n)). I assume having an O(1) dispatcher when some contract has 5+ methods is a cool achievement.\r\n\r\n## Motivation\r\n\r\nContracts with tens of methods could have really slow dispatcher for most of the methods. Computing keccak256 and 2 jumps is a relatively cheap way to dispatch.\r\n\r\n## Specification\r\n\r\nWe just need to brute-force `magic` values at compile time to achieve all selectors being mapped into 0..N-1 values. The complexity of such brute force should be `N^N/N!`. If the number of selectors is really huge we could, for example, find the first function for splitting into a few groups by 8, and then use different magic for each group. Having 1 magic number you could split 32 selectors into 4 groups by 8 and then find magic for each group. Finding magic for a group of 8 would take `8^8/8! = 416` iterations in average. Seems possible to do this in compile-time.\r\n\r\nPseudocode:\r\n```solidity\r\nconst index = keccak256(abi.encodePacked(selector + (magic << 32))) % selectors.length;\r\nJUMP(READ(table_start + index));\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Backwards Compatibility\r\n\r\nThe resulting dispatcher code should be fully compatible for external calls with any other versions of the dispatcher.\r\n",

    "body": "O(1) would be interesting, but what would be the magnitude of the constant cost? Would it be less than the current costs? It would be nice to see some numbers.\r\n\r\nI played around a bit with @k06a's script yesterday. For ~10 selectors it works well but any more than that the brute forcing can take a long time. I think most contracts have more than 10 selectors, so splitting into buckets and doing multiple dispatches would likely be necessary. Not sure if it needs to be done with multiple keccak like @k06a suggested, perhaps the cheapest approach is combination of binary search until reaching small enough buckets that we can generate and use an O(1) dispatch table.",

If we take `selector % N` we've got a pretty good hash function that splits in pretty small buckets. The cheapest dispatch function might be %N followed by linear if-else matches. It's not constant time, but it sounds like the difference would be up to a small constant with high probability.",

    "body": "My current thinking is that we should use the hash function `(selector ^ salt) % n` but `n` should not necessarily be the number of functions (call it `N`), and potentially several values of `n` should be tried. The result will not be a perfect hash function but one where \"buckets\" are small enough that searching within that bucket still is an optimization wrt status quo.\r\n\r\nA remaining question for me is what range of `n` it makes sense to look at. In part this question relates to what we want to optimize for. For large `n` it will be faster to find a salt that results in less collisions (smaller buckets), but there will also be more \"empty space\" in the bytecode which may impact deployment cost.\r\n\r\nI started [this document](https://observablehq.com/@frangio/constant-time-function-dispatch) to analyze the probabilty distribution of bucket sizes for combinations of `N` and `n` (sorry different variable names in the doc).",

    "body": "I found a relatively cheap way to build a perfect hash function but this function itself is not O(1):\r\n- Find minimal M that every SELECTOR % M is disctinct.\r\n- Find some S that (SELECTOR + S) % M have M2 < M giving different rests, repeat\r\n\r\nSo the function will look like the following:\r\n```\r\nx = addmod(selector, s1, m1)\r\nx = addmod(x, s2, m2)\r\nx = addmod(x, s3, m3)\r\n...\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt will come to Mx = N relatively fast even on a huge number of selectors. But the execution of such hash function in EVM could take 100-200 gas for 100 selectors. I don't like it, so still looking for a better solution.",
