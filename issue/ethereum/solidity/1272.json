This function returns EVM bytecode that, when executed, behaves like the snippet.\n\nThis should also be supported in the generic json input https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/1129 where the target contract key could be used for this.\n",

    "body": "This seems to be revived in light of https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/issues/19836, should we continue the syntax discussion here? We'd basically need some syntax to compile the code supplied for such a new eth_call, right? Then solidity code using this syntax could e.g. be compiled via standardjson and then passed on to the eth_call directly? This all sounds pretty cool :-).\r\n\r\nSyntax wise I like @axic's proposal - I'd generally think of this as a special kind of \"external inheritance\". So I'm in favour of\r\n```\r\nsnippet Name for Token {\r\n  // basically any kind of contract function including fallback functions and named functions\r\n}\r\n```\r\nWhen actually using this for eth_call we could in fact append a function signature and an argument encoding to the produced bytecode similar to constructor arguments for contracts and that way execute some specific function in the snippet code. That way one could compile one snippet containing a lot of functions with arguments, etc. and call any of them. Code size won't really matter, right?",
