  "body": "The following code is expected (by a developer using any other language) to catch failures related to the call.\r\nBut instead, it reverts.\r\nThis is due to the very confusing semantics of the \"try/catch\" construct in solidity: the catch block will only be called if the actual external code was reverted, but it might still revert in some **compiler-generated** code\r\n\r\n```solidity\r\npragma solidity ^0.8.12;\r\n\r\ninterface Xface {\r\n    function func() external;\r\n}\r\n\r\ncontract Test {\r\n    function run() external {\r\n        try Xface(address(0)).func()  {\r\n            console.log('successfully called');\r\n        } catch {\r\n            console.log('catch everything');\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Suggestion**: solidity should not generate a \"revert\" code between the try and catch. Instead, it should jump into the catch block.\r\n\r\nCurrently, the following checks are done by solidity, and it reverts if any of these validation fails:\r\n- if the called method is \"void\", it first performs `extcodesize`, to validate the target indeed has some code\r\n- if the called method is expected to return something, it validates that `returndatasize` is not zero\r\n- if there are returned values, it decodes  them and of course validates they were encoded correctly.\r\n",

I think its confusing that the code that is covered syntactically by try/catch causes a revert. \r\nThe assumption of a developer is that this is a \"safe-zone\".\r\nThe purpose of try/catch is catch errors caused by things outside of the control of the developer and continue the normal path of the code.\r\nWith the current implementation, it is nearly impossible to achieve that, without resorting to low level calls and assembly - since the compiler explicitly generates \"revert\" calls before calling the external function (to handle \"no-contract-at-target\") and after the external function returns (when it fails to parse the response)\r\nNote that both of these cases fall under \"not under the contact developer's control\" category - just like reverts in the called external function\r\n\r\nI understand that you can't add a real try/catch, since the EVM only support reverting an external call. \r\nBut I **DO** expect the code-generator to \"honor\" the developer's intention that reverts inside the try/catch range will be captured.",

    "body": "Just to chime in here. I have a use case related to ERC165-like \"light\" interface checking. Basically, try/catch guards could be used to experimentally call an external contract function and act on the basis of which catch block executes. This would have many useful applications. One in particular would be to check if one of the transfer addresses in a token transfer appears to be something that smalls like a particular kind of token wallet etc.\r\n\r\nOf course, something as simple as:\r\n```\r\n    function respondsTo(address c, bytes4 sel) internal view returns(bool result) {\r\n        assembly {\r\n            let freeMemory := mload(0x40)\r\n            mstore(ptr,sel)\r\n            result := staticcall(gas(),c,freeMemory,4,0,0)\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\nserves such a purpose for view functions that take no parameters. Perhaps Solidity does not want to encourage this kind of usage, but a gas-efficient mechanism that could query external contracts in this way seems like a good thing. I know more efficient dispatchers are being discussed, and this consideration might be one to include in that implementation.",
