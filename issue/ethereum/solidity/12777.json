  "body": "## Abstract\r\n`solc --link` is the only input mode that modifies input files in place. In all the other modes the compiler prints to stdout by default and only writes to files when the `--output-dir` option is used. I think that the `--link` option should be changed to behave like the other input modes.\r\n\r\n## Motivation\r\nThe way it works currently, apart from just being inconsistent, is one of the reasons why we do not have any tests covering it - our command-line test framework is not suited for testing the output written to a file. Especially when the output overwrites the input file.\r\n\r\n## Specification\r\n- By default `--link` should print to stdout.\r\n- When `--output-dir` is used, the output should go to a file in the output directory. The name of the file should match the input file. The expected file extension is `.bin` but we don't enforce or change that, even if the input file has a different extension.\r\n- Add some command-line tests covering this input mode\r\n- Add a test for this input mode in [`test/solc/CommandLineParser.cpp`](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/develop/test/solc/CommandLineParser.cpp), similarly to how other modes are covered. The test should simply use as many command-line flags as possible and make sure the resulting `CommandLineOptions` object looks like it should.\r\n\r\n## Backwards Compatibility\r\nThe change is not backwards compatible.",
