    "body": "So, basically, you'd like to have a way to ask the compiler to automatically generate an internal getter function for any mapping?\r\n\r\nNote that currently you can do this with with external functions if your mapping is public (because the compiler generates a getter in that case):\r\n```solidity\r\ncontract C {\r\n    mapping(int16 => uint256) public map;\r\n\r\n    function foo(function(int16) external view returns (uint256)) internal view {}\r\n\r\n    function test() public {\r\n        foo(this.map);\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWith internal functions you can achieve this by defining the function yourself as long as you can access the original storage variable:\r\n```solidity\r\ncontract C {\r\n    mapping(int16 => uint256) map;\r\n\r\n    function mapGetter(int16 key) internal view returns (uint256) {\r\n        return map[key];\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    function foo(function(int16) view returns (uint256)) internal view {}\r\n\r\n    function test() public {\r\n        foo(mapGetter);\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nIf you only have a variable reference via a `storage` parameter, this is not currently doable but will be if we implement #12297.\r\n\r\n> Backwards Compatibility\r\n> No issue\r\n\r\nThere is an issue, at least with your proposed syntax. Due to `using for`, state variables can have arbitrary members and adding a special `toFunction` would conflict with that. We would have to reserve that name and that would be breaking.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nFinally, can you describe your use case? We need to determine if this is common/useful enough that it would make sense to add special language support for it. What benefit would it have that defining a function manually (or using a closure after #12297) would not provide?",
