    "body": "Sure @christianparpart! I use the built-in LSP client, the official [nvim-lspconfig](https://github.com/neovim/nvim-lspconfig) configuration for it, [nvim-cmp](https://github.com/hrsh7th/nvim-cmp) and an auto-completion engine that uses LSPs as completion sources, and [nvim-lsp-installer](https://github.com/williamboman/nvim-lsp-installer) to easily install and manage LSP servers.\r\n\r\nYou can install all of this using [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug)\r\n```\r\nPlug 'neovim/nvim-lspconfig'\r\nPlug 'williamboman/nvim-lsp-installer'\r\nPlug 'hrsh7th/nvim-cmp'\r\nPlug 'hrsh7th/cmp-nvim-lsp'\r\n```\r\n\r\nand then use `:LspInstall solc` to install solc. That's it! I didn't customize the LSP config. The default config can be found [here](https://github.com/neovim/nvim-lspconfig/blob/master/lua/lspconfig/server_configurations/solc.lua). It sets the nearest ancestor with a .git folder as the root directory, and triggers the server on .sol files. The [LSP install script](https://github.com/williamboman/nvim-lsp-installer/blob/main/lua/nvim-lsp-installer/servers/solc/init.lua) gets the server from the GitHub releases page.\r\n\r\nThe only problem is that I get the error quite randomly, meaning that it doesn't fire right away sometimes. Though it always shows up quite consistently after I write some code. I still couldn't figure out what code exactly triggers it since it shows up quite often anyway...",

What distribution / OS are you testing on?\r\nMind, that we recently also merged some improvements on the LSP side, not necessarily to address this, but it might have had an impact. In case you still see the errors, I would like to give you a binary that produces a debug solc.log file, that you could hand me back for inspection.",

I installed it using [nvim-lsp-installer](https://github.com/williamboman/nvim-lsp-installer), which now migrates to [mason](https://github.com/williamboman/mason.nvim/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md). Mason doesn't support [vscode-solidity]((https://github.com/juanfranblanco/vscode-solidity)) yet, but I'm working on a PR to add. You can find my conf on my [dotfiles repo](https://github.com/anajuliabit/dotfiles)",
