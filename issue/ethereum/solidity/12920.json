  "body": "## Abstract\r\n\r\nTLDR: Implement a flag similarly to Vyper's \"--storage-layout-file\" flag. See: https://githubhot.com/repo/vyperlang/vyper/issues/2572\r\n\r\n## Motivation\r\n\r\nHaving the ability to control storage layout (slots) brings interesting benefits.\r\nFor one, controlling the exact storage location provides greater stability and consistency between contracts and different versions.\r\n\r\nFor example, the `owner()` view method may compile to different bytecodes depending on the underlying storage slots, even though their implementation logic is essentially the same. It forces contracts to implement the same logic again and again, deploying duplicated code, accumulating junk at expense of deployers & entire blockchain infrastructure.\r\n\r\nAs a consequence - this will open the possibility to access storage by name rather than by number, in a JSON-like manner.\r\n\r\nFor example, if I have the following contract:\r\n\r\n```\r\nimport \"@openzeppelin/contracts/access/Ownable.sol\";\r\nimport \"@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC20/ERC20.sol\";\r\n\r\ncontract MyCode1 is Ownable, ERC20 {\r\n    constructor() ERC20(\"\", \"\") { }\r\n}\r\ncontract MyCode2 is ERC20, Ownable {\r\n    constructor() ERC20(\"\", \"\") { }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nCurrently, the slot for `owner` depends on the order of inheritance, as shown in the build-info output: (slot 0 vs. 5 in the examples above)\r\n\r\n```\r\n\"storageLayout\": {\r\n  \"storage\": [\r\n    {\r\n      \"contract\": \"contracts/test2.sol:MyCode1\",\r\n      \"label\": \"_owner\",\r\n      \"slot\": \"0\",\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n      \"contract\": \"contracts/test2.sol:MyCode1\",\r\n      \"label\": \"_balances\",\r\n      \"slot\": \"1\",\r\n    },\r\n\r\n...\r\n...\r\n\r\n\"storageLayout\": {\r\n  \"storage\": [\r\n    {\r\n      \"contract\": \"contracts/test2.sol:MyCode2\",\r\n      \"label\": \"_balances\",\r\n      \"slot\": \"0\",\r\n    },\r\n    ...\r\n    {\r\n      \"contract\": \"contracts/test2.sol:MyCode2\",\r\n      \"label\": \"_owner\",\r\n      \"slot\": \"5\",\r\n    }\r\n  ],\r\n...\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Specification\r\n\r\nInstead of using slot numbers starting from 0, 1, 2, ... I suggest using the storage name in ASCII, with zero padding to 32-bytes.\r\nWith name-as-key, \"owner\" will be at slot 0x6f776e6572000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000.\r\n\r\nHelper methods can be implemented, e.g. `readKey(bytes32 key)`, `writeKey(bytes32 key)`, etc. for cross-contract storage access.\r\n\r\n## Backwards Compatibility\r\n\r\nIt is not expected to break existing ABIs.\r\n",

(or 0x00..00\"owner\") but even if you control the slots completely - why wouldn't you be able to, if as you said this can be done via .slot anyway? technically even existing mappings have collisions, they will just be as rare as private key collisions.\r\n\r\n> Solidity guarantees that the storage slots would remain unchanged across compiler versions for the same contract.
