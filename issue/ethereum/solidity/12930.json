  "body": "## Abstract\r\n\r\nThe ability to cast `bool`s to `uint256` or `uint8`.\r\n\r\n## Motivation\r\n\r\nBranchless optimizations are becoming more and more common to see lately, but often they require dropping down into inline assembly since their efficiency depends on being able to treat a bool as a uint that resolves to either `1` in the true case or `0` if false. Solidity should support performing these conversions without jumps or branches as bools are already represented this way under the hood. Requiring devs to drop into assembly is presenting them with a bunch of extra footguns to hurt themselves with, adding this ability to the high level language will make Solidity safer for devs and make these optimization techniques more readable.\r\n\r\n## Specification\r\n\r\nI am not opinionated as to whether bools would have to be cast to `uint8`s or `uint256`s assuming they use the same amount of gas. I will demonstrate both possible options:\r\n\r\n```solidity\r\nbool status = false;\r\nassert(uint256(status) == 0);\r\n```\r\n\r\n```solidity\r\nbool status = true;\r\nassert(uint8(status) == uint8(1));\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Backwards Compatibility\r\n\r\nI don't think this would introduce any backwards compatibility issues, but please correct me if so!",

    "body": "Rather than allowing this cast, we'd prefer working towards improving code generation and the optimizer to have ``status ? 1 : 0`` result in branchless code to begin with, i.e. have the solidity optimizer perform the branchless optimization you want on its own.
