    "body": "@wminshew Thanks. Just to summarize the above mimal repro, the compiler assumes that `block.timestamp` is movable / copyable across the contract. So, instead of `dup`-ing, it's just repeating the computation (opposite of the title of the issue).\r\n\r\n```solidity\r\nfunction f() external {\r\n    uint timeStart = block.timestamp;\r\n    vm.warp(100);\r\n    // compiler may replace the following value by `timestamp()` instead of `dup`-ing the value in stack.\r\n    // Because `warp` can change this, this doesn't work for testing\r\n    timeStart;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo fix this, we'll have to change the side-effects of the opcode `timestamp`. Since this is only relevant for testing, we'll likely need to create a flag for this. I wonder if we should just start creating a `--debug` flag for such changes.",
