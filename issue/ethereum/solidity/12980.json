  "body": "## Abstract\r\n\r\nAccording the discussion with @chriseth at the FV hangout, it may happen that a contract that compiles with the new Yul-based optimizer does not compile when disabling that optimizer. The reason seems to be a new compiler/optimizer pass that spills stack variables to memory. As far as I understand, when disabling the optimizer, this pass is currently not run and contracts may not compile due to lack of stack space. It would be great if this pass could always be run, independently of other (optimization) passes, to make sure the optimizer can always be disabled if needed.\r\n\r\n## Motivation\r\n\r\nUsers should have the option to disable the optimizer. For instance, it seems that without optimization more debug information is preserved and users may want to disable the optimizer when testing/debugging/verifying their code before deployment.\r\n\r\n## Specification\r\n\r\nWhen a user can compile a contract with the new optimizer they should also be able to compile it when disabling the optimizer (e.g., through existing flags/options).\r\n\r\n## Backwards Compatibility\r\n\r\nThis should not break backwards compatibiliy. In fact, it seems like the current (Yul-based) compilation pipeline breaks backwards compatiblity.\r\n",
