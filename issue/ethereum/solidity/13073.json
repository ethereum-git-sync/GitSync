I tried setting a higher timeout but the error message appears instantly with a zero or much higher timeout. I have seen SMTChecker take much longer when the timeout condition was involved.\r\n\r\nI assume you're getting the expected output with the CHC checker? I find it odd that only the BMC checker identifies the assertion violation on my system.\r\n\r\nSeparate topic, but do you know if the solidity docker image has z3 to allow for SMTChecker to run from the image? If so, I can test this as an alternative.",

    "body": "Yea the output is from CHC. BMC runs much faster but gives a lot of false positives.\r\n\r\nThe results can be quite sensitive to the z3 versions, a lot changes in between them. So I think if you use a newer z3 (4.8.14 for example) it should work.\r\nFor instance, `soljson.js` that Remix uses has an embedded z3. If I run your example with `pragma experimental SMTChecker;` on Remix it actually gives the counterexample too.\r\n\r\nI know Ubuntu ships z3 4.8.12, which is quite unfortunate since the latest is already 4.8.17. If you want a newer z3, Solidity also maintains a z3 package that has the lib and the binary. Just use the PPA https://launchpad.net/~ethereum/+archive/ubuntu/cpp-build-deps and install `z3-static`.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure about the docker version having z3, but I suspect it doesn't.",

    "body": "As far as I can tell, solc is looking specifically for a file named `libz3.so.4.8`. I only had files named `libz3.so` and `libz3.so.4` in default lib dirs, but manually copying the `libz3.so.4` file to `libz3.so.4.8` got SMTChecker working again. Based on some installs/reinstalls of individual z3 packages, the `libz3-4` ubuntu package added libz3.so.4 while `libz3-dev` added libz3.so and libz3.so.4. I didn't see any dynamic z3 library added by installing `z3-static` from the ppa. I tried installing `libz3-static-dev` from the ppa instead `z3-static`, but I got the same error where solc warns `libz3.so.4.8 was not found.` and did not see any new libz3.so file added with either ppa package.\r\n\r\nAt this point, I'm aware that I can get the proper SMTChecker result for the original example I mentioned with remix. We can close the issue since that is resolved. But if you're willing to continue exploring the proper install process to get a local setup working, even offline (twitter link is in my profile), I would find it helpful. I haven't found clear instructions online for installing a newer z3 dynamic lib and have seen at least one case where solc was compiled from source with static linking to z3 to get SMTChecker working.",

    "body": "I see the Z3 issue linked above has been closed but I have not examined or tested the change myself. Could that resolve the issue on debian/ubuntu?\r\n\r\nAnother idea that avoids the dynamic z3 library loading is to publish a table that matches the solc release version with the corresponding z3 library version that the solc binary is compiled with. That way debian users can download a solc release version and then download a matching static z3 binary with the correct version. Even if this information about which solc version matches which z3 version is already available somewhere, it might be helpful to make it more easily accessible in the docs.",
