  "body": "## Abstract\r\n\r\nFollowing an Interface pattern for every contract leads to unsolvable inheritance situation even if it should not.\r\n\r\n## Motivation\r\n\r\nI tried to implement a number of base contracts with interfaces. The pattern I was following is that a Interface for a contract should have all visible functions and all events for that contract. For that reason each interface that describes a contract that already derives from an other contract also extends the interface of the derived class.\r\nWhile this was a success with the base contracts it leads to unsolvable inheritance errors when using this contracts as base for other contracts.\r\n\r\n## Specification\r\n\r\nInterfaces should not be taken into account when checking the inheritance graph.\r\nInstead since they hold no implementation all interfaces of a contract should be merged to a single interface that hold the functions and events of all used interfaces.\r\nThat interface is then used to test if all functions are implemented as needed.\r\n\r\n## Backwards Compatibility\r\n\r\nTo prevent code breaking changes. Interfaces that work that way should be marked with a keyword.\r\n\r\nFor example: virtual interface <name> is <IName>...\r\n\r\n## Current Workaround\r\n\r\nThis would also reflect the workaround I used at the moment to manually copy methods of base interfaces to the derived one without linking the interfaces with the \"is\" keyword. The drawback of this workaround is that in big codebases changes in the base interfaces are not reflected in the derived Interfaces without manual intervention.",

    "body": "### The feature\r\nI think you have a point. The linearization order matters mostly for two things: deciding which virtual function to call and the order of construction/initialization of base contracts. They both do not matter for interfaces since their functions cannot have implementations and then cannot have constructors or variables that would need to be initialized.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure if I'm not missing some corner case but it seems to me like we could indeed relax the rules here and not issue this error for interfaces. The change would not be breaking because it would not affect code generation and would just allow compiling new code that used to result in an error.\r\n\r\n### Workaround\r\nStill, even with the current implementation you do not need any wild workarounds to deal with this error as long as you control the inheritance hierarchy. Problems with linearization should always be solvable by rearranging the inheritance lists you have and/or avoiding unnecessary inheritance from the same contract at different levels.\r\n\r\nYou're getting this error because the order in which you place contracts on the inheritance list imposes some constraints that the compiler must satisfy:\r\n- A contract must must not come before any contract it inherits from.\r\n- A contract must must not come before any of its siblings to the left on the inheritance list.\r\n\r\nIt would be easier to discuss if you gave an example of a situation you cannot resolve. Since you didn't, let's look at the simplest possible case:\r\n```solidity\r\ninterface I {}\r\ncontract C is I {}\r\ncontract D is C, I {}\r\n```\r\nIf you have something like this in your code you're telling the compiler that `C` must come before `I` (because it inherits from `I`) but also `I` must come before `C` (because `C` is before `I` on the inheritance list). This is impossible to satisfy.\r\n\r\nYou can work around this by either rearranging the inheritance list (`D is I, C`) or cleaning it up so that `I` does not appear in the hierarchy twice (`D is C`).\r\n\r\nFor contracts doing this might affect contract behavior but in case of interfaces it's always safe (which is also the reason why the feature you're requesting would be possible at all).",

    "body": "> The difference in my order is because I wrote the example out of memory and I tried many alternative orders in my attempt so solvle the error at the MyToken class.\r\n> The at the moment unsolveable linearization error happens at MyToken.\r\n> Even if the base classes compile fine.\r\n> There is no way to get MyToken working in my example.\r\n\r\nThen I think I don't understand what you mean. Can you give me a complete example that triggers this error? Because when I adjust your example the way I stated above I get this and this does not cause any error for `MyToken`:\r\n\r\n```solidity\r\ninterface IERC20 {}\r\ninterface IOwnable {}\r\ninterface IERC20AltApprove {} // holds decreaseAllowance and increaseAllowance functions.\r\ninterface IERC20Metadata is IERC20 {} // optional metadata elements.\r\ninterface IERC20Burnable is IERC20Metadata {}\r\nabstract contract Context {}\r\nabstract contract Ownable is IOwnable, Context {}\r\ncontract ERC20 is IERC20Metadata, IERC20AltApprove, Context {}\r\ncontract ERC20Burnable is IERC20Burnable, Context, ERC20 {}\r\n\r\ninterface IMyToken is IOwnable, IERC20Burnable, IERC20AltApprove {}\r\ncontract MyToken is IMyToken, Ownable, ERC20Burnable {}\r\n```\r\n\r\n> Also, I am not sure if this is a separated feature or related. If you use interfaces in that way you came across cases where\r\nan Interface holds a function that is defined in the interface and also already implemented in some base class.\r\n\r\nYes. There are reasons for this (see this topic on the forum if you're interested in details: [Thoughts on override(A, B) syntax](https://forum.soliditylang.org/t/thoughts-on-override-a-b-syntax/767)) but in the end we decided to relax the override restrictions for interfaces. This is tracked in #12665.\r\n\r\n> Another drawback I came over my workaround is that while you can define functions and override them in the way shown you can not do the same thing with events.\r\n\r\nYou probably mean a situation like this?\r\n```solidity\r\ninterface I {\r\n    event E();\r\n}\r\n\r\ninterface J {\r\n    event E();\r\n}\r\n\r\ncontract C is I, J {}\r\n```\r\n```\r\nError: Event with same name and parameter types defined twice.\r\n --> test.sol:6:5:\r\n  |\r\n6 |     event E();\r\n  |     ^^^^^^^^^^\r\nNote: Other declaration is here:\r\n --> test.sol:2:5:\r\n  |\r\n2 |     event E();\r\n  |     ^^^^^^^^^^\r\n```\r\n\r\nNot sure if we'll do it but it's worth considering at least. Feel free to submit it as a separate issue with a feature request.\r\n\r\nThere's a technical limitation that prevents us from allowing situations where multiple events with the same signature are in scope: #11114. This can be solved but the solution requires bumping the Natspec version which would be a breaking change. But recently we have decided to do it a bit differently to make it non-breaking (#13086) so we might actually be in a position to allow this after all.\r\n\r\nBut then there's the question of whether it's a good idea. This needs some discussion. Providing a good, practical use case would help us make a decision.",
