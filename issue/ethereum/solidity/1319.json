  "body": "TODO:\r\n - [ ] make inline assembly functions globally available\r\n\r\nMost of the ideas below have been implemented. What we are missing is functions that can be used across multiple inline-assembly blocks. In the code generator, this is supported via \"named labels\".\r\n\r\nIt is not really supported in the assembly parser, though, but we could always prefix all known inline assembly functions that parsed correctly, perhaps even without body?\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n\r\nSolidity (inline) assembly should support macros in the following way:\r\n```\r\ndefine <macroname>(<param1>, ..., <param_n>) -> [(<retparam1>, ..., <retparam_m>)] { <assembly code> }\r\n```\r\nThe defined macro will be visible and usable in inline assembly blocks in the whole code unit (this includes the current contract, base contracts and internal functions of libraries that are called, but construction-time code is disconnected from runtime code).\r\n\r\nRemark: currently labels are only visible in the current inline assembly block, so we should aligns those two behaviours.\r\n\r\nIt is an error to define two macros of the same name in the same code unit.\r\n\r\nIf the return parameters are not given, the compiler will try to infer the stack difference caused by the macro. If it is not able to do that or if there are two code paths with different stack differences, this is an error.\r\n\r\nInside the assembly code, both the parameters and the return parameters are available as variables and they are assigned contiguous stack slots (left: deep, right: top) where the first parameter and the first return parameter refer to the same slot. If there are more parameters than return parameters, the surplus stack items are popped automatically.\r\n\r\nA macro can be used in the same way as an opcode can be used with the same restriction for usage in functional style notation.\r\n\r\nNote that macros are more similar to custom opcodes - they are not a replacement system in that their arguments are evaluated before they are \"called\" just like with evm opcodes and not inserted literally into the macro's body.\r\n\r\nIf a macro is called, it is usually just replaced by its body, but it is also possible to use macros recursively. In this case, and also if it makes sense from an optimization perspective, the macro body is moved out-of-place and it is called like a function.\r\n\r\nThe compiler will also define several globally available macros. Those macros will always start with `$` and thus, such macro names can be considered reserved.",

    "body": "Your example usage shows that we have to refine our definition of macros with regards to their return values. As currently specified, `offset` and `size` point to the same stack slot, but most people will probably not read that part. So it is probably better to shift the arguments and return values around at the end of the macro. This makes short macros much less efficient, unless the optimizer can do its job there.\n\nWhat about adding the following part to the specification:\n\nIf return parameters are provided, the macro is expanded with the following prefix and suffix:\n\nprefix: allocate a new stack slot for each return parameter, setting them to zero\nsuffix: shift the stack around removing the argument variables\n\nIf no return parameters are provided (in the sense that they are named variables, the macro can still return values to the stack), there is no prefix and suffix.\n",

We have to introduce another lookup method for function identifiers (and not just variable identifiers). Furthermore, inline assembly functions have to be registered at the compiler context, and not just the inline assembly AST node. Compiler-generated functions have a different prefix and thus cannot clash (but you can still use them if you want).",

    "body": "My general feeling is that epsilon engineering effort should go into improving inline assembly.  Instead, Solidity should be looking at what people are building with inline assembly and figuring out higher level constructs that facilitate doing that in Solidity, so they don't need to drop to inline assembly.\r\n\r\nAnytime someone drops to inline assembly suggests a failure of the language, or at least an area where the language can improve.  Also, inline assembly really isn't appropriate for smart contracts, which are supposed to be public, easily auditable code blocks and assembly makes the code harder to read/audit.",
