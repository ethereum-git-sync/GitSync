Simply using `.slot` on a storage reference to a mapping in assembly triggers it.\r\n\r\nLooks like the bug has been there all the way since the IR was introduced (or at least the `--ir` option) in 0.5.8. Back then the syntax was `_slot`, not `.slot` though. Between 0.5.10 and 0.7.0 it was causing an uncaught exception in `map::at()` but starting with 0.7.1 it's again an ICE.\r\n\r\n### Repro\r\n`test.sol`:\r\n```solidity\r\ncontract C  {\r\n    mapping(uint => uint) private m;\r\n\r\n    function g() public {\r\n        mapping(uint => uint) storage mPtr = m;\r\n        assembly {\r\n            pop(mPtr.slot)\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n```\r\nsolc test.sol --ir\r\n```\r\n```\r\nInternal compiler error:\r\n/solidity/libsolidity/codegen/ir/IRVariable.cpp(52): Throw in function solidity::frontend::IRVariable solidity::frontend::IRVariable::part(const std::string&) const\r\nDynamic exception type: boost::wrapexcept<solidity::langutil::InternalCompilerError>\r\nstd::exception::what: Invalid stack item name: slot\r\n[solidity::util::tag_comment*] = Invalid stack item name: slot\r\n```",
