We ask only that you do your best to provide as much information as possible so we can better help you.\r\n- Support questions are better asked in one of the following locations:\r\n    - [Solidity chat](https://gitter.im/ethereum/solidity)\r\n    - [Stack Overflow](https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/)\r\n- Ensure the issue isn't already reported.\r\n- The issue should be reproducible with the latest solidity version; however, this isn't a hard requirement and being reproducible with an older version is sufficient.\r\n\r\n*Delete the above section and the instructions in the sections below before submitting*\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## Description\r\n\r\nCompiler gives an error `InternalCompilerError: Invalid stack item name: slot` when compiling with `--via-ir`, \r\nwhen an assembly block calls `.slot` on a reference to a mapping.\r\n\r\n## Environment\r\n\r\n- Compiler version: 0.8.15\r\n\r\n## Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\nFound in ERC721A, when compiling with `--via-ir`\r\n\r\n```solidity\r\nfunction _getApprovedAddress(uint256 tokenId)\r\n    private\r\n    view\r\n    returns (uint256 approvedAddressSlot, address approvedAddress)\r\n{\r\n    mapping(uint256 => address) storage tokenApprovalsPtr = _tokenApprovals;\r\n    // The following is equivalent to `approvedAddress = _tokenApprovals[tokenId]`.\r\n    assembly {\r\n        // Compute the slot.\r\n        mstore(0x00, tokenId)\r\n        mstore(0x20, tokenApprovalsPtr.slot) // This line causes the compiler error.\r\n        approvedAddressSlot := keccak256(0x00, 0x40)\r\n        // Load the slot's value from storage.\r\n        approvedAddress := sload(approvedAddressSlot)\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe code compiles normally without `--via-ir`.\r\n\r\nSee: https://github.com/chiru-labs/ERC721A/pull/364",
