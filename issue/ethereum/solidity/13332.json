    "body": "The layout of storage in the presence of inheritance is determined by the [C3 linearization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C3_linearization) of the inheritance graph.\r\nAdding the interface changes the C3 linearization, so the change in the storage layout is expected, conforms to the current specification and is in that sense not a bug.\r\n\r\nThat being said, I'm actually wondering, whether interfaces should be exempt from being treated the same as contracts in the C3 linearization - out of my head, it seems to me that this would be possible and might actually be beneficial. This would be a gravely breaking change, though, so at least for the time being, the change in storage layout is expected and this behaviour cannot be changed in the short term...",
