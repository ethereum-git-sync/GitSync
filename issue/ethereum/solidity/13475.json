  "body": "There seems to be a lot of memory overallocation when dealing with `memory` structs, depending on the exact construct used to work with them. Apparently the situation improved in v0.7.6, which lists 'avoid memory allocation for default value if it is not used' on its changelog.\r\n\r\nPrior to that, the following snippet:\r\n\r\n```\r\nstruct MyNiceStruct {\r\n    uint256 a;\r\n    uint256 b;\r\n}\r\n\r\nfunction alloc() private pure returns (MyNiceStruct memory) {\r\n    MyNiceStruct memory myStruct = MyNiceStruct({ a: 3, b: 4 });\r\n    return myStruct;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nresults in 192 bytes being allocated, corresponding to 3 (!!!) instances of `MyNiceStruct`. These allocations are apparently triggered by:\r\n a) the declaration of a variable in the function\r\n b) the assignment using the special struct assignment syntax\r\n c) the fact that there's a struct return value\r\n\r\nIf the result of `alloc()` were to be assigned to a struct at the callsite, that'd result in yet another allocation.\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nIn current versions, all the way up to 0.8.16, the situation is still bad, though not _quite_ as bad. The assignment to the result of `alloc()` seems to no longer cause an allocation, but I still run into double allocations if I either use the `MyNiceStruct({ ... })` initialization syntax, or declare a local struct instead of using a named return value.\r\n\r\nThe following seems to be the only way to make the compiler allocate space for just one instance of the struct:\r\n\r\n```\r\nfunction alloc() private pure returns (MyNiceStruct memory myStruct) {\r\n    myStruct.a = 3;\r\n    myStruct.b = 4;\r\n}\r\n```",

    "body": "Thanks for the reply @hrkrshnn. I didn't see any mention of structs there however, are there any concrete plans for those?\r\n\r\nTo be honest, structs feel like a neglected feature: they're the only `memory` type that exhibits this weird auto-allocation behavior, they have strange copy semantics (close to value types, but they're sort of a reference type?), and are just all around wasteful to use if trying to use the 'standard' language constructs (return statements, initialization with named arguments, etc.). The [documentation doesn't even show memory structs at all](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.13/types.html#structs): it looks as if they're just a hack to get packed storage variables.\r\n\r\nAll of this makes me avoid structs whenever possible, since I find I cannot predict wheter my usage will result in wasted allocation. Is there some plan to address these issues?",

The slots are allocated per Yul function post optimizer. Disjoint paths through the call graph of these functions can be assigned shared slots. So if you're lucky and the 10 mutually exclusive code paths end up in separate yul functions that live in disjoint paths in the call graph, only one word will be allocated.\r\n\r\nWhether slots can be shared, *could* be determined on a more fine-grained level than per Yul function, but (as the main topic of this issue correctly touches) the compiler is much worse at wasting memory during free-memory pointer based allocation, so our priority is to first fix that and only then to fine-tune assigning memory slots for variables further (if it turns out that's worthwhile).",
