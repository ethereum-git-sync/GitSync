    "body": "Yeah, the opcode name in assembly output is something to think about.\r\nWhat's your thoughts about making this a full hard switch depending on the evm version setting? I.e. remove ``block.difficulty`` entirely for Paris and also only emit and parse ``prevrandao`` in assembly - while keeping everything as is for <Paris?\r\nThe error message for the use of ``block.difficulty`` or the opcode with evm version set to paris could mention that you can just specify a different evm version to make it work again.\r\n\r\nGiven that you could restore the previous behaviour easily,  makes it less of a severe breaking change. We could also hold off on making paris the default evm version until we have tooling feedback on this...\r\n\r\nEDIT: also promoting this to ``must have`` since #13517 depends on a decision on this.",
