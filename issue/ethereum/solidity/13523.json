We ask only that you do your best to provide as much information as possible so we can better help you.\r\n- Support questions are better asked in one of the following locations:\r\n    - [Solidity chat](https://gitter.im/ethereum/solidity)\r\n    - [Stack Overflow](https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/)\r\n- Ensure the issue isn't already reported.\r\n- The issue should be reproducible with the latest solidity version; however, this isn't a hard requirement and being reproducible with an older version is sufficient.\r\n\r\n*Delete the above section and the instructions in the sections below before submitting*\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## Description\r\nThe compiler is crashing with the following error message:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ yarn test\r\nyarn run v1.22.10\r\n$ npx hardhat compile; truffle test --network local\r\nSolidity 0.8.17 is not fully supported yet. You can still use Hardhat, but some features, like stack traces, might not work correctly.\r\n\r\nLearn more at https://hardhat.org/hardhat-runner/docs/reference/solidity-support\r\n\r\nNothing to compile\r\nUsing network 'local'.\r\n\r\n\r\nCompiling your contracts...\r\n===========================\r\nassertion failed [block != nullptr]: BasicBlock requested for unrecognized address\r\n(BuilderBase.h:550 block_for_offset)\r\n/bin/sh: line 1: 12129 Trace/BPT trap: 5       truffle test --network local\r\nerror Command failed with exit code 133.\r\ninfo Visit https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/cli/run for documentation about this command.\r\n```\r\n\r\nI contacted truffle support, and they advised that it was a compiler bug and it should be reported here.\r\n\r\n\r\n<!--Please shortly describe the bug you have found and what you expect instead.-->\r\n\r\n## Environment\r\n\r\n- Compiler version:\r\nTruffle v5.4.11 (core: 5.4.11)\r\nSolidity - 0.8.17 (solc-js)\r\nNode v18.7.0\r\nWeb3.js v1.5.2\r\n\r\n- Target EVM version (as per compiler settings): 0.8.17\r\n- Framework/IDE (e.g. Truffle or Remix): 5.4.11\r\n- EVM execution environment / backend / blockchain client: ganache v7.4.1 (@ganache/cli: 0.5.1, @ganache/core: 0.5.1)\r\n- Operating system: Mac OS\r\n\r\n## Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\nThis error is intermittent, I will record a video to demonstrate it and share it in the comments.

We do have a struct called [`BasicBlock`](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/v0.8.17/libyul/backends/evm/ControlFlowGraph.h#L172-L207) but no `BuilderBase.h` (it's part of the control flow graph instead).\r\n\r\nIf it's a compiler problem it should be reproducible just by running `solc` (or solc-js) on it without Truffle or Hardhat.
