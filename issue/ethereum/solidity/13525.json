  "body": "## Description\r\n\r\nGiven these two contracts (which from an ABI point of view, return exactly the same values):\r\n\r\n```solidity\r\ncontract A {\r\n    function a() pure external returns (uint256 x, uint256 y) {\r\n        return (0, 0);\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\ncontract B {\r\n    struct XY {\r\n        uint256 x;\r\n        uint256 y;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    function b() pure external returns (XY memory xy) {\r\n        return XY({x: 0, y: 0});\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n`contract  A` compiles to `0.122 kb`\r\n`contract  B` compiles to `0.157 kb`\r\n\r\nThis is a problem, because since tuples are not yet a first-class datatype in Solidity, you are forced to use structs in some situations where tuples should work, which causes the contract size to increase. For example, you can't declare a tuple type inside a struct. This doesn't work:\r\n\r\n```solidity\r\nstruct Data {\r\n    uint256 a;\r\n    (uint256 x, uint256 y) b;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou have to use instead:\r\n\r\n```solidity\r\nstruct Data {\r\n    uint256 a;\r\n    XY b;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Environment\r\n\r\n- Compiler version: 0.8.17\r\n- Target EVM version (as per compiler settings):\r\n- Framework/IDE (e.g. Truffle or Remix): Hardhat\r\n- EVM execution environment / backend / blockchain client: \r\n- Operating system: Linux\r\n",
