  "body": "Looking across contracts, it appears that most modifiers don't change state: they're generally used for checking preconditions and \"condition-orientated\" programming.  IMO this is good since they are kept simple, and since they don't change state, their order doesn't matter.  So instead of the term `modifier`, as a starting point how about another (additional) keyword for them?  The cases where people are changing state in a modifier can remain the same and use `modifier`, but for new contracts where they don't change state, a term other than `modifier` seems more fitting as the contract isn't getting modified.\r\n\r\nSome suggestions are `condition`, `precondition`, `pre`.  Other languages from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_by_contract could be consulted for other potential names.",

But it would be good if there were ways that the language could minimize misuse of features: I don't think modifier abuse is an issue currently, but something for us to keep in mind.",
