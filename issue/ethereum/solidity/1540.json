  "body": "Right now the `solc` compiler can only intake the sources of solidity files/source maps. But when I'm compiling more than say, 15 contracts (which I do often, as many of us use the EVM/solc as a testing environment). The compile time takes forever, sometimes up to 10+ minutes depending on the source. Many of the contracts I'm compiling have already been compiled (and have not changed). Often times, I may only be changing one or two at most. So I'd like to request a bytecode input feature (if something like this is possible and doable).\r\n\r\nUsage:\r\n```js\r\nvar solc = require('solc');\r\nvar input = {\r\n    'lib.sol': 'library L { function f() returns (uint) { return 7; } }',\r\n    'cont.sol': 'import \"lib.sol\"; contract x { function g() { L.f(); } }',\r\n};\r\nvar bytecode = {\r\n    'cont.sol': '0x00..',\r\n};\r\nvar output = solc.compile({ sources: input, bytecode: bytecode }, 1);\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis way, if the bytecode is presented for a specific contract, then it won't recompile the source, instead it will just use the source provided.\r\n\r\nOptimizations like this allow us to have a faster environment to develop large Solidity applications. This way,  the build environment can optimize compile time by presenting bytecode that often times does not change.\r\n\r\nThoughts?\r\n\r\nOne con/Fix:\r\n - what if the bytecode is old and the contract has actually changed, but the build environment improperly handled the change, and did not recompile code properly.\r\n    Potential Fix: instead of the bytecode map being \"contract_name\": \"bytecode\", it could be: \"keccak256(contract_code)\": \"bytecode\". This way, the map will only map to that contracts bytecode and nothing else. This would avoid a situation where bytecode is presented for an old contract code.\r\n\r\nNote, I also posted this issue in `solc-js` repo, not sure which was more appropriate.",

If not, we'd be happy to try and take a look at some point, if this is something you want to add but do not have the bandwidth to.\r\n\r\nEdit: I see there was some talk about the ABI not being enough for type information - this is true, but given the compiler can now be stopped at the parser stage(?) this might not be an issue anymore?",
