This seems unnecessary.\r\n\r\n# Alternate proposal:\r\n\r\nThe client can already see where the program crashed by checking the program counter. Simply add a mapping of <program counter => String> for assertion operations having names. Or possibly <program counter => assert code> and <assert code => String> if you want a normal form database. This saves adding and additional code to programs. Also, you can add assertion language retroactively to existing contracts!\r\n\r\nOf course the compiler will need to treat these special REVERT assembly instructions specially: you cannot optimize by merging code paths if it results in two distinct \"colors\" of REVERT instructions being merged. \r\n",

    "body": "@fulldecent:\r\n\r\n> I don't see why an additional value needs to be put on the stack before revert. This seems unnecessary.\r\n\r\nA [`REVERT`](https://github.com/axic/EIPs/blob/75121e281a8737f979a969394b4360d4d277c115/EIPS/eip-140.md#specification) always consumes two stack items - to determine memory location and length of data to be returned. The actual return ~~value~~ data comes from memory.\r\n\r\n> The client can already see where the program crashed by checking the program counter. Simply add a mapping of <program counter => String> for assertion operations having names. (...)\r\n\r\n(Also described by @axic [a few comments back](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/1686#issuecomment-348012218).)\r\n\r\nThis requires every client that wants human-readable error messages to have this mapping/database. If it's supposed to be distributed with the ABI, that allows for easy translation (to other human languages) of the error messages; but it also means the error messages can be spoofed.\r\n\r\nMore importantly, relying on the program counter like this will not work nicely in loops; and, in general, only helps to determine _where_ it failed, but not _why_.\r\n\r\nConsider, for example, a loop that goes through N addresses and performs a check on every element. `REVERT` returning a program counter will not be able to indicate which address failed the check.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nEDIT: [EIP issue 838](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/838) (no-status) might be relevant.",
