If the prerelease part is empty, this is a proper release (this should only be done from the release branch and potentially err if such a version already exists). The build specifier should contain the commit hash and potentially the platform and whether the source is modified from the commit. The prerelease specifier should be `-nightly-year-month-day`.\n",

So:\n\n```\nv0.3.5 - current release\nv0.3.6-alpha1-13b324b - nightly\nv0.3.6-alpha2-88231aa - nightly\nv0.3.6 - next release\n```\n\nThis is also compatible with semver.\n",
