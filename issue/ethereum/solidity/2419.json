    "body": "> is probably outputing the yul AST as JSON tree instead of as just a string of operations.\r\n\r\njust to be sure i got this correctly: inlineAssembly is a subset of yul. (Or at least it is parsed by the yul::Parser). \r\n\r\nSo in broad strokes my idea to approach this would be: \r\n- 1) define helper functions(or a class?) ```Json::Value AsmConverter::toJson(yul::Literal/Identifier/...)```\r\n- 2) in ASTJsonConverter::visit(InlineAssembly): do \r\n```[\"operations\"] = AsmJsonConverter::toJson( _node.operations())``` (instead of Printedstring)\r\n  - (AST::InlineAssembly's member m_operations is a yul::Block with the AST in it)\r\n\r\n- Questions:\r\n      - this is not using the accept/visit/endvisit-scheme. As I understand this was mostly to be able to do stuff like annotations. But all \"Asm-nodes\" are structs (see AsmData.h) which should be straightforward to (recreate) and which are not annotated. \r\n\r\n\r\n",

    "body": "## Problem:\r\n\r\nI need to process a *yul::Block*, which is a vector of *Statement*., which is a boost::variant() for manyt hings(yul::Expression, yul::Instruction, yul::Label,....>\r\n\r\nSo as i understand I can deduce the type of the statement using boost.variant's ```.which```,\r\nbut I still don't know how to access the values within that struct.\r\n\r\nE.g. if I know that a statement is of type *Instruction*, I still can't call \r\nstatement.instruction. (\"no member instruction in boost::variant<Expression, Label,...>).\r\n\r\nCan i cast it somehow? \r\n\r\nSo, (as I think I can not cast) the solution to get something out of the\r\nboost::variant is to write a dedicated *visitor*, as is done for the location in AsmData.h::lines 86-97\r\n\r\nSo my idea would be to write one visitor (similar as locationOf) per type of struct in the variant.\r\n\r\n#### example, for \"VariableDeclaration\" \r\n\r\nit is defined like this:\r\n```struct VariableDeclaration { langutil::SourceLocation location; TypedNameList variables; std::unique_ptr<Expression> value; };```\r\n\r\ntherefore the function (two actually) would be:\r\n\r\n```\r\ntemplate <class T> inline std::pair<TypedNameList, Expression> getVariableDeclarationInfo(T const& node) {\r\n   return boost::applyVisitor(VariableDeclarationExtractor(), node) \r\n}\r\n\r\nstruct VariableDeclarationExtractor: boost::static_visitor<std::pair<TypedNameList, Expression>{\r\n   {\r\n   template <class T> std::pair<TypedNameList, Expression> operator()(T const& node) const {\r\n        return make_pair(node.variables, node.values)\r\n   }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis seems like a lot of work. Can you point me to a smarter way to do that?",
