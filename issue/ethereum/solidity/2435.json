    "body": "I would like to open the discussion on this again. As mentioned earlier, an different assignment symbol is not sufficient, because we also need to consider passing data along function calls.\r\n\r\nMy proposal would be that reference types are always assigned and passed by reference by default. If this is not possible (because it is an assignment to storage or from storage to memory or across function calls), an rvalue can be turned into an rvalue of \"copyable type\" by using `copy(...)`. The actual copy will only be performed with the assignment or external function call itself, i.e. `copy(x)` is not yet a copy of `x`. The type of `copy(x)` does not allow any member access or operators. `copy(copy(x))` is invalid. Assigning a copyable type to a local variable of storage reference type is invalid.\r\n\r\nThis will result in rather verbose syntax for external function calls. An alternative would be to use a symbol instead of an actual function call (i.e. `%x` or whatever).\r\n\r\nAnother alternative would be to perform copies by default and make references explicit. I think this is not as good because it could result in too many unnecessary (and unnoticed) copy operations.",

    "body": "I think always passing by reference by default and requiring a ``copy(...)`` construct is good - the only question is whether the resulting verbosity for external function calls is in fact a problem.
