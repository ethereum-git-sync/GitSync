  "body": "It appears to me that further separation of concerns between `require()` and `assert()` would be helpful. From the documentation:\r\n\r\n> Note that assert-style exceptions consume all gas available to the call, while require-style exceptions will not consume any gas starting from the Metropolis release.\r\n\r\nThis is of course a reference to https://github.com/ethereum/eips/issues/140, and the new `REVERT` opcode. In this case the choice between the two is at a lower level than the source code. \r\n\r\n> The difference between the two is that assert should only be used for internal errors and require should be used to check external conditions (invalid inputs or errors in external components). \r\n\r\nThis is a completely distinct use case, which I believe is a static analysis concern), above the source code level. \r\n\r\nI'm not sure what if anything the advantages of an `invalid opcode` exception would be, but I think it would be helpful to be able to throw an internal error AND have the benefits of `REVERT` (gas refunds + pass a return value). \r\n\r\nIt's possible the issue title is overly prescriptive, there might be a better way to resolve this.

    "body": "Big 👍 for this.\r\n\r\nPersonally, I understand and value how this is supposed to ease the development of formal verification tools for Solidity code but it appears to me it would make more sense to use the `0xfd` opcode in all the exceptions by default.\r\n\r\nMaybe there is some obvious reason I'm missing as to why this is engineered this way?\r\n\r\nEDIT: Just missed the answer above while typing.\r\n\r\n@axic is it possible that this is going to promote some waste of gas?

    "body": "@GNSPS my opinion is that you should not just throw an exception on overflow, because the fact that at overflow was possible usually means that you did not think of some of the edge cases, and furthermore, throwing an exception might forever stall some process. For example, take the following code (from ENS) - perhaps not the best example:\r\n\r\n```\r\n    function setBalance(uint newValue, bool throwOnFailure) onlyRegistrar onlyActive {\r\n        // Check if it has enough balance to set the value\r\n        if (value < newValue) throw;\r\n        value = newValue;\r\n        // Send the difference to the owner\r\n        if (!owner.send(this.balance - newValue) && throwOnFailure) throw;\r\n}\r\n```\r\nIf you just checked for underflow in `this.balance - newValue` and throw on failure, it might be that you never get your money back. It is much better to use formal methods to prove that underflow can never happen in this code path. Indeed, `this.balance` should always be equal to `value` and thus `newValue` will be at most `this.balance` because of the check in the first line of the function. If you forget to put this check, the \"safeMath\" method will lock up your money (at least in this function), while the assertion checking method will notify you about your error at compile-time.",
