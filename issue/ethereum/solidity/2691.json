  "body": "I would like the ability to disable compiler warnings on a per-line basis using something like comments or pragma.  C++ has a mechanism to also disable comments across a block using `#pragma push (disable: 1234)` and `#pragma pop`.  I'll leave it up to the language designers to decide the exact mechanism based on which one is most reasonable to implement.  The key is that I need to be able to disable any single specific warning in the source code that is generating that warning.\r\n\r\nWith `solc` becoming more and more opinionated with its compiler warnings, there needs to be a way to disable them selectively.  At the moment, we use `solc` compiler warnings/errors as a CI gate block but we are finding that some of the warnings _should_ be ignored, yet we don't have a reasonable way to do this right now.\r\n\r\nFor example, we have a `SafeMath` library that leverages `using SafeMath for <type>`.  This library does function overloading/shadowing so that it can have both `add(uint256,uint256)` and `add(int256,int256)` in the same library.  I appreciate the warning, but I need the ability to disable it on a case-by-case basis.  The same goes for a number of other warnings that have been added recently.  In general I think are all very valuable, but may not be able to be applied exhaustively to all code.",

Same for returndatasize, methinks.\r\n\r\nWe are also seeing `Warning: Jump instructions are low-level EVM features that can lead to incorrect stack access. Because of that they are discouraged. Please consider using \"switch\" or \"for\" statements instead.`  We are getting these from compiling Aracnid's string library - they are in functions we aren't using so we can prune them from our copy of the library.  But if `jump` is not going to be allowed shouldn't it be deprecated and eventually removed from the language?  BTW I don't have an opinion on this - just want to be able to get to a clean build when using the available features of the language.\r\n",

    "body": "@chriseth Following up on your comment from Feb. 12, I'm adding a couple of examples where it's impossible to get rid of warnings via code changes.\r\n\r\n### ERC165\r\nThe examples to implement ERC165 contracts rely on calling `this` in the constructor to refer to function selectors: `supportedInterfaces[this.supportsInterface.selector] = true;`\r\nHowever, the use of `this` in constructors is now flagged with a warning: https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/583\r\n\r\nWhile ultimately, the code inspection for this warning should be able to distinguish between \"allowed\" and \"disallowed\" uses, the 583 ticket discussed the complexity of it, so it's not likely to be implemented anytime soon. So, in the meantime, it would be a great help to be able to turn these warnings off selectively (i.e. by line comments).\r\n\r\n### Abstract contracts\r\nWhen using the OO concept of abstract contracts, you end up with multiple warnings for \"unused var\". Example (written off the cuff, no guarantee this compiles, only to make the point):\r\n```\r\ncontract MyInterface {\r\n   function processBytes32(bytes32 _param);\r\n   function processAddress(address _param);\r\n   function processUint(uint _param);\r\n}\r\n\r\ncontract AbstractMyInterface is MyInterface {\r\n   function AbstractMyInterface() internal {}\r\n   function processBytes32(bytes32 _param) {}\r\n   function processAddress(address _param) {}\r\n   function processUint(uint _param) {}\r\n}\r\n\r\ncontract MyCustomImpl is AbstractMyInterface {\r\n   // custom impl chooses only to overwrite one function of the abstract contract\r\n   function processBytes32(bytes32 _param) {\r\n      // do something with bytes32\r\n   }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn this example, the only way to avoid the \"unused var\" warnings is to not use the concept of abstract implementations at all and implement empty functions in all contracts implementing the interface. A programmer should not have to make such a design choice due to warnings being annoying. Having the ability to flag the abstract functions with a comment to ignore the warnings would therefore be very helpful.",

    "body": "Are there any plans/spec for implementing this? I'd guess a major blocker would be coming up warning ids, so that only specific ones are suppressed.\r\n\r\nFalse-positive warnings are currently a pain point when developing/using Solidity libraries (in the software engineering sense of the word, not a Solidity `library`): often, base contracts will have methods to be overridden by their children, like in [`OpenZeppelin's Crowdsale`](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/v2.3.0/contracts/crowdsale/Crowdsale.sol):\r\n\r\n```\r\nfunction _preValidatePurchase(address beneficiary, uint256 weiAmount) internal view {\r\n    require(beneficiary != address(0), \"Crowdsale: beneficiary is the zero address\");\r\n    require(weiAmount != 0, \"Crowdsale: weiAmount is 0\");\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThat function is `view` because overrides may require e.g. reading from storage in order to perform their task, but it doesn't need this attribute in the base contract - `pure` would suffice.\r\n\r\n```\r\nopenzeppelin-solidity/contracts/crowdsale/Crowdsale.sol:138:5: Warning: Function state mutability can be restricted to pure\r\n```\r\n\r\nThere's no workaround for this (relatively common) scenario, which emits warnings on both the library developer and user's workflows. Having a way to silence warnings selectively (e.g. `// solc-disable-line possible-stricter-mutability`) would be extremely helpful.",
