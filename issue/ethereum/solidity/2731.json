  "body": "I first noticed this issue on various sites like Etherscan and Remix, which use the Solidity compiler, and have been pointed here as the source of the issue.\r\n\r\nWhen the JSON ABI is generated, the order of the methods/events in the JSON object seems to be arbitrary. It's not alphabetical, and it's not in the same order as the methods are presented in the contract. For a contract with many functions, that makes it a royal pain to try and find the one you care about. And for sites that just take the ABI and show the methods in order (like the Etherscan website takes the ABI and any of the `constant` ones it shows in ABI-order on the \"Read Contract\" tab ([example](https://etherscan.io/address/0x78faea8994efe7fc448e743b7b342e1a96ba3807#readContract)). Scanning through that list for the one method you care about is rather tedious.\r\n\r\nI'd suggest ordering the items in the generated JSON ABI blob in the same order they are in the contract's source code. The compiler has all the information it needs to figure out that order, and if a particular website/DApp wants to have it in alphabetical order, they can sort on their own. If it was the other way around, websites using the JSON ABI blob wouldn't be able to sort by the contract source code ordering without parsing the source code itself (which it may or may not have access to).",

    "body": "The current ordering appears to be random and not based on the source code nor alphabetical. What is the \"certain way\" that Remix already uses? \r\n\r\nTaking for example, my contract at `0x78FAEA8994EfE7FC448E743B7b342e1A96Ba3807` which I [linked to originally](https://etherscan.io/address/0x78faea8994efe7fc448e743b7b342e1a96ba3807#readContract): In the source of that contract, I laid out the methods in an order that makes sense for the contract itself:\r\n\r\n```\r\n...\r\ngetBookingCount(address _who) constant returns (uint count)\r\ngetBooking(address _who, uint _index) constant returns (uint _unicornCount, VisitType _type, uint _startBlock, uint _expiresBlock, VisitState _state, uint _completedBlock, uint _completedCount)\r\nbookSpaVisit(uint _unicornCount) payable\r\nbookAfternoonVisit(uint _unicornCount) payable\r\nbookDayVisit(uint _unicornCount) payabl\r\nbookOvernightVisit(uint _unicornCount) payable\r\nbookWeekVisit(uint _unicornCount) payable\r\nbookExtendedVisit(uint _unicornCount) payable\r\n...\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn this chunk of methods, those `bookFooVisit` functions are increasing length-of-stay order (an \"Overnight\" visit is longer than a \"Day\" visit, which is longer than an \"Afternoon\" visit), which makes sense for this particular contract's usage. The owner-only methods are way at the bottom to keep them out of the way, and the generic/constant methods are further up.\r\n\r\nBut currently, the generated ABI for this contract has the methods in a different order:\r\n```\r\n...\r\nbookAfternoonVisit\r\naddBooking\r\nvisitLength\r\nbirthBlockThreshold\r\nowner\r\nbookDayVisit\r\nbookOvernightVisit\r\n...\r\n```\r\nIn this chunk of the ABI ordering, the \"Afternoon\", \"Day\", and \"Overnight\" methods do happen to be in the right order, but there's other methods between them. And the \"Spa\" method is way after this chunk, and the \"Extended\" one is way before it. This is the ordering in the JSON in the generated ABI in Remix, and in Etherscan. In Remix, when the compiled contract is deployed, the form for working with the contract is in a different order:\r\n\r\n```\r\n...\r\nbookDayVisit\r\nwithdrawForeignTokens\r\nbookAfternoonVisit\r\nchangeRepoSettings\r\ncompleteBooking\r\nchangeGroveAddress\r\n...\r\n```\r\n\"Day\" is now before \"Afternoon\", as well as other changes. Remix's interaction form puts all the `constant` functions first, but other than that I can't figure out the ordering logic of the rest of the form.\r\n\r\nMy point is, any contract-interacting client can alphabetically sort these methods given a list of them. However, only the contract parsing/compiling script has access to the author's original ordering, and I believe that should be maintained both for consistency across contract-interacting clients (if they do no re-sorting, they're at least the same as everyone else) and preserving the original author's intent. The current sort ordering out of the Solidity compiler appears to have no ordering and has no benefit at all in finding the method you're interested in. So, sorting it some way would at least help the people who want it that way without any other work, would provide a sensible default, and wouldn't hamper those who still want to re-sort it another way.",

    "body": "Aha, thanks for pointing that out! That code in Remix doesn't actually do what its intended to do. Having two separate `sort` calls means that the second sort is clobbering the first one. You end up with methods that definitely have `constant` functions first, but within the \"constant\" and \"non-constant\" groups, they're no longer in alphabetical order. For example, here's a screenshot of that contract I was using as an example in Remix:\r\n\r\n![Remix](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/250250/29395374-f7658c3e-82d5-11e7-8ec6-dce1537795da.PNG)\r\n\r\nBut thanks for finding that code section; I [submitted a patch](https://github.com/ethereum/browser-solidity/pull/696) to fix that to actually be what's intended there for the Remix app.\r\n\r\nBut for the actual solidity compiler, possibly adding Natspec (or other style) annotations could be a robust solution down the road, but for what's available right now, with what all authors have to develop (the order of the methods in the source code), preserving that in the compiler output I think would be a decent starting point.",

It is interesting how Python's `json.dumps()` and Javascript's `JSON.stringify()` even produce different output formats. They don't make it easy for us do they? :)\r\n\r\nPerhaps the output ABI (for hashing) should just be sanitized to have no tabs, spaces, newlines whatsoever. This would be more reliable than hacking around with the nuances of each language's JSON serialization libraries.",

Given the difficulties of determining a \"best\" sorting order based on attributes of the function/signature, might I propose my original suggestion again: have the \"canonical\" sort be by the order the developer put the methods in the Solidity source code. That order is only known by the compiler (which is what we're talking about here); any other implementations that use the ABI down the road can determine their own alphabetical/function-type/etc.-based sort ordering if they so desire (none of those sort types require additional metadata about the original Solidity source to rearrange into that order). Doing it this way, the compiler would be acting in a more \"unbiased\" method in my opinion, and letting downstream apps add different logic to it if they so chose?",

    "body": "I completely understand the raw/native source code ordering approach that @MidnightLightning is proposing. However, there are a few things to consider. Please see below.\r\n\r\n**Solidity**\r\nSolidity supports multiple inheritance as well as polymorphism, and as such, specific functions can be found in multiple places and in multiple files. Would you agree that once a significant amount of inheritance and polymorphism is implemented, the smart contract kind of looses that linear source code layout anyway.\r\n\r\nSolidity has hoisting; this allows functions to be written in any order whatsoever. If source code ordering was implemented, a contract could have several different valid ABIs (depending on how the smart contract developer chose to assemble the smart contract functions and/or assemble external/inherited contracts). I guess some could see this as a feature and other could see this as a concern, if considering [reproducible builds](https://reproducible-builds.org).\r\n\r\nLet's look at this from another angle.\r\n\r\n**Vyper**\r\n\r\nA Vyper contract is saved in a single file, only. The Vyper compiler does not support inheritance or polymorphism. Vyper does not have hoisting; a function definition must appear in the source code before it can be called. This deliberate design organically creates quite an ordered sequence. At present the Vyper compiler does not perform any ordering of the ABI. The layout of the ABI appears in the same order as the layout of the source code. From this perspective, source code ordering makes a lot of sense. However I can confirm that there is still potential to re-order function positions in a contract's Vyper source code (without requiring hoisting) which will create a different ABI. \r\n\r\nSo at the end of the day, as with Solidity, there can definitely still be many different (valid) ABIs for the exact same smart contract.\r\n\r\n**Ordering**\r\nAt present, multilevel ordering (primarily) by `type`, then (secondary) by `name` does make sense. This can also be said for the internal list of `inputs` and `outputs` given that a specific individual function will never have two inputs (or outputs) with exactly the same `type` and `name`.\r\n\r\n**Hashing**\r\nGive that human readability of the ABI is desirable. Lexicographic sorting (of human readable words) can be employed throughout the entire sorting process. Whilst hashing essentially provides a unique content addressable key, sorting by hashes of already deterministic text detracts from the human readability.\r\n\r\nHowever, from a reproducible builds perspective, once the overall ABI is completely sorted (and sanitized i.e. `sub(r\"[\\n\\t\\s]*\", \"\", sortedAbi`), the end result (the high level ABI) will produce the desired key which could play a part in assisting with source code authenticity work. \r\n\r\nIn addition to this, a hash of the end result can be used in unit testing. For example, the hash can be used in Python, Rust, Javascript, C++ etc. to confirm the correct behavior of each of the different compiler's ABI sorting implementation. With eWASM around the corner it would be brilliant if the community could come up with an ordering design for keeps.\r\n\r\nHope this helps.\r\nBrilliant chatting to you all.\r\nKind regards\r\nTim\r\n\r\n",
