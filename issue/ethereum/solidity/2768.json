  "body": "Over the past few years, there have been significant advances in making compiler error messages understandable and usable by humans. The Elm team has done [some excellent work](http://elm-lang.org/blog/compiler-errors-for-humans) pointing the way forward, and both the [Rust](https://blog.rust-lang.org/2016/08/10/Shape-of-errors-to-come.html) and [Scala](http://scala-lang.org/blog/2016/10/14/dotty-errors.html) communities have picked up from that.\r\n\r\nIt's absolutely essential for smart contract developers to improve their understanding of the language they work with and to be able to focus their mental energies on the actual logic of their contracts. I think we ought to give more thought to the way error messages are presented in Solidity.\r\n\r\nThis issue is meant to track the work required to improve the reporting of Solidity errors and to discuss different approaches.\r\n\r\n### Recommended reading\r\n\r\n * http://elm-lang.org/blog/compiler-errors-for-humans\r\n * https://blog.rust-lang.org/2016/08/10/Shape-of-errors-to-come.html\r\n * http://scala-lang.org/blog/2016/10/14/dotty-errors.html\r\n\r\n### Roadmap\r\n\r\n*(to be discussed)*\r\n\r\n * Collect code samples that trigger different error messages and see if we can improve them\r\n * Assign a unique number to each Solidity error message and warning\r\n * Improve formatting of basic messages (colors, layout, etc.)\r\n * Add methods to show additional information (notes, explanations, etc) and take advantage of them where appropriate\r\n * Discuss additional ways in which we can improve reporting\r\n\r\n### Questions\r\n\r\n * How do we maintain compatibility with the standard JSON interface?\r\n * Can we move away from Boost's errinfo and have a richer API for presenting errors?\r\n * Should we add a small library like termcolors or rang for handling colored output? termcolors looks battle-tested and BSD licensed, so GPL-compatible. \r\n\r\n**Update 08/23:** added questions about errinfo API and colored output.",
