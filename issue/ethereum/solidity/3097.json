    "body": "@VarunWachaspati sorry, I cannot assign this to you because you are not part of the project, but please feel free to work on it.\r\n\r\n@androlo I think there are separate issues for most of the items you mention. An important aspect of natspec adoption is also to get it into further tools. Mist, metamask, etherscan, etc. should display them and also use the templating language. Perhaps you could connect to the relevant people and ask/help them implement it?\r\n\r\n",
