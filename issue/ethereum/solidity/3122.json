It's one of our roadmap goals for this year, but we also have immutable reference types on the roadmap and I think @ekpyron will be working on them first.\r\n\r\nThe question is also how breaking it will be. Changing how `pure` works would definitely be breaking and would have to be scheduled for 0.9.0. But I think we're more likely to leave `pure` as is and introduce a new mutability level for functions that can be evaluated at compilation time and I think could be done in 0.8.x.",
