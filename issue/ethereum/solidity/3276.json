  "body": "Apologies if this has already been suggested.\r\n\r\nCurrently if we want to extend the functionality of a contract `B` with some additional functionality in `A` we have two options:\r\n  1. declare a `contract A extends B {}` and access all items of `B` from within the context of `A` implicitly. I find this can make logic harder to follow when `A` and `B` are defined in separate files.\r\n  1. declare `contract A { B b_member; }`. This requires actually deploying another contract and being allowed only to access public items. Additionally, each call requires actually making an EVM sub-call, which is fairly expensive.\r\n\r\nI would like to be able to declare something along the lines of\r\n\r\n```\r\ncontract A {\r\n    B b_member inline;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nwhere `b_member` will be laid out in storage and code the same way as in option 1, but will function the same way as in option 2, but with private items also accessible. This kind of composition is helpful for code quality but should not harm performance.\r\n\r\nAlternatives:\r\n  - Only have public items accessible from an inline member contract. The member's logic may require certain invariants about the state of its storage to be upheld, and can expose a safe public interface. Bypassing the public interface could lead to invariants being broken. If access to private items is allowed, it should be actively discouraged and linted against.",

    "body": "> have an implicit \"self\" struct that might be at a different place than the default beginning of storage, right?\r\n\r\nyes, from an implementation standpoint that sounds correct. Although one alternative would be make it work exactly as `extend` does but prefix item names with the member name. e.g. if B has a member `bar` and `A` has an inline member `B foo`, The identifier is changed to `foo.bar` instead of just `bar`. I am not familiar with solc internals so it's hard for me to say which implementation approach is easier -- although this will probably break tokenization.\r\n\r\n> You currently can get something like this by using a library with internal functions and a struct as first parameter\r\n\r\nInteresting! I think the ergonomics could be better but it might be worth a shot.",
