    "body": "I'd like to reopen this issue. It seems to impair composability for smart contracts quite a bit!\r\n\r\nMany developers are writing contracts with `external` methods that correctly aren't called internally, but they're completely unaware that ancestor methods can't call `super.methodName()` as a result. There's nothing in the docs or compiler about why.\r\n\r\nFor example, I can't write a non-fungible token contract that inherits from a base contract and calls `if (super.isApprovedForAll(...)) { ....` to check if a user approved access. The compiler shows the error: `\"TypeError: Member \"isApprovedForAll\" not found or not visible after argument-dependent lookup in contract super ERC1155Tradable\"`.\r\n\r\nWhat's the security benefit of preventing `external` methods from being called by child instances? I understand the case where a state-modifying method like `setApprovalForAll(...) external` would be confusing if it could be called by an inheriting contract, but I can't think of a scenario where it would matter.",
