In https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/3741 you mention it is based on \"sections\" but in the given example, how do you map section 0 to the relevant opcodes?\r\n\r\nThe documentation at https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/develop/miscellaneous.html#source-mappings is quite limited and does not explain how to use the \"f\" field, especially since I get f = 0 for every part.\r\n\r\nThanks!",
