I got your first one working.\n\n```\nufixed a = uint128(1) + ufixed(2);\n```\n\nThe second two in the examples you laid out, based on how we defined implicit conversion are currently impossible. \n\n0.5 currently converts to ufixed0x8 and that does not convert with a uint128. \n\nuint(7) / 2 stays a uint256 after the division by 2 (it's truncating), and therefore cannot convert to ufixed128x128. And no... 0.5 \\* uint(7) is not the same as uint(7)/2....one is a ufixed0x8 and the other is dividing by an integer....kind of confusing....I'm thinking we may need to fix this up. Open to all suggestions....the only thing I can think up right now is to create a class atop integer type and fixed point and make it a super class of some kind...\n",

This means that\r\n`fixed64x7` is a type of 64 bits and a value `x` of this type is interpreted as the number `x / 10**7`.\r\n\r\nThe type `fixed` is an alias for `fixed128x19`. The reason is that this type simplifies multiplication and also allows conversion from `int64` without loss of precision / range.",

    "body": "A good question raised by @meowingtwurtle: should an explicit typecast from fixed point to integer be a reinterpretation of the bits or an actual integer conversion?\r\n\r\nCurrently typecasting is a mix between the two, but mostly it is an actual conversion and not reinterpretation. One example is function type to address (the address of the external contract) and to bytes4 (the signature of the external function).\r\n\r\nI think we should always do an actual conversion, e.g. fixed point to integer is the integer only part. Reinterpretation can always be done via assembly if needed.\r\n\r\nIn the future it may make sense introducing a notation to separate the two.",

For me, interest rate of 2.45% is neither decimal nor binary, but just fractional.\r\nIn Ethereum smart contracts it is usually convenient to store 1-second interest rate, rather than annual.  This allows calculating compound interest for arbitrary time interval just by raising 1-second interest rate to the power of number of seconds in the interval (in Ethereum all time intervals always contain integer number of seconds).  Such 1-second rates are usually something like 0.000000094% (corresponds to 3% annual rate).  For me, both, decimal and binary representation works equally well for such rates.\r\nMainstream Javascript implementations use binary integers and binary floating point, so at least for Javascript community, binary numbers are more familiar than decimals, in terms of range, precision, and rounding.",

For JSON, number format is implementation-dependent, but [RFC 7159][1] explicitly says that:\r\n\r\n> This specification allows implementations to set limits on the range\r\n   and precision of numbers accepted.  Since software that implements\r\n   IEEE 754-2008 binary64 (double precision) numbers [IEEE754] is\r\n   generally available and widely used, good interoperability can be\r\n   achieved by implementations that expect no more precision or range\r\n   than these provide, in the sense that implementations will\r\n   approximate JSON numbers within the expected precision.  A JSON\r\n   number such as 1E400 or 3.141592653589793238462643383279 may indicate\r\n   potential interoperability problems, since it suggests that the\r\n   software that created it expects receiving software to have greater\r\n   capabilities for numeric magnitude and precision than is widely\r\n   available.\r\n\r\nAlso, for this\r\n\r\n> As long as source code is written with decimal literals then fixed point numbers should only be decimal based.\r\n\r\nI would not agree again.  Solidity source code is usually written with both decimal and hexadecimal literals used equally often.\r\n\r\nIt seems that we are mixing three very different cases here:\r\n\r\n1. Numbers that are intrinsically integer but are rendered with certain fixed number of decimals.  This includes money amounts such as Ether (stored in Wei but rendered in Ether with 18 decimals), Bitcoin (stored in Satoshi, but rendered in Bitcoin with 8 decimals), USD (stored in cents but rendered in USD with 2 decimals), etc.  As long as these numbers are stored as integers, they do not need any fraction numbers support from compiler and platform. (Most common case)\r\n2. Real numbers with the more the better range and precision.  In mainstream programming languages de-facto standard for such numbers is IEEE 754 double precision floating point numbers  that have enough range and precision for most real-life applications. (Quite common case)\r\n3. Fractional numbers with particular decimal precision.  Such numbers are often used to meet requirements of formal accounting rules, and usually accompanied with strict rounding rules such as [round half to even rule][2].  Mainstream languages usually do not support such numbers natively, but only via libraries.  Though, specialized financial-oriented languages may provide core support for such numbers.

You can always use integers and keep a fractional divisor in your head and for that divisor, it is mostly irrelevant whether it is a power of 2 or of 10.

If you store the exponent dynamically as in floating point numbers, using powers of two makes more sense, but we do not store it dynamically.\r\n\r\nIn general, I do not think that we should use arguments like \"mainstream programming languages use X\", but rather \"mainstream programming languages use X because of the following advantages\".\r\n\r\nMy impression is that most mainstream programming languages use binary exponents because of the above argument about floating point numbers and because floating point numbers are a feature of their target machine.

Fixed point numbers behave differently when multiplied and divided, for example 2.00 * 3.00 = 6.00, while 200 * 300 = 60000.  And, most importantly, they have different overflow behavior.  For example, if one uses signed 32-bit integers to represent fixed point numbers with 3 decimals, then 1000.000 * 2000.000 will return 2000000.000 (fits into signed 32-bit), while 1000000 * 2000000 will overflow.  Thus one cannot just write something like `x * y / 1000` to simulate fixed point multiplication via integers.",

Metamask actually uses contract ABIs when presenting transactions to the user;\r\n2. There is/are well-written userland fixed point implementation(s); and\r\n3.
