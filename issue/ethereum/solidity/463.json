    "body": "No you can't put this type of code in libraries because they can just be used without extending at all (basically there's no language features that can stop someone from using a function that may conflict with normal code).\n\nThe example is I make a contract with functions for writing directly to storage through assembly. If someone just extends the contract, or I put it in a library they can just link to, then they may then add new variables, and the auto allocation could conflict with the assembly routines that uses hard coded storage addresses, leading to weird errors.\n\nMaybe it's a documentation thing, or maybe this type of optimization is not really a good idea. Having `final` or `sealed` or something is just how I'd generally deal with stuff like this, but perhaps it's not good for Solidity. If you're cleaning up issues just close this one.\n",
