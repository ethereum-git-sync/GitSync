  "body": "Certain use-cases require a check to be applied to all or at least many functions. Most notably, this includes a general smart contract deactivation function (as replacement for dangerous selfdestruct), a \"pausable\" pattern and so on.\r\n\r\nModifiers already provide basic support, but it is too easy to forget a modifier to be mentioned with a single function, also it requires quite some typing and can get cluttered fast.\r\n\r\nModifier areas ( #623 ) are a similar solution, but they do not work with inheritance.\r\n\r\nThis proposal tries to start a discussion about how modifier areas could work better with inheritance. The drawback of this proposal is that it provides less choice about which functions to apply.\r\n\r\nSyntax proposal:\r\n```\r\nusing modifier <modifier> for *;\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis applies the given modifier to all functions in this contract, including inherited functions and all functions in potential derived contracts.\r\n\r\nIt might make sense to restrict this to functions that are non-view functions.\r\n\r\nPotential syntax: `using modifier <modifier> for payable, non-payable;`",
