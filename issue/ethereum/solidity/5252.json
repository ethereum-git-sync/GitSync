Given the number of runs, however, consistently reviewing all of them would be pretty tedious.\r\n\r\nWe could instead have a weekly run that gathers all compilation times, creates a short table and posts it to gitter. Maybe even with a diff to the previous version if we store old results somewhere (e.g. as a CI artifact).\r\n\r\nOr the report could be committed by CI to a small repo created just for that purpose.
