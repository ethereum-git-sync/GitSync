    "body": "I think that in general, array types of elementary types that are convertible are not convertible. The reason behind is that the conversion, even if possible, might require actual code for the conversion or different storage layout. For example, even though `unit8` is convertible to `uint16`, a storage array of `uint8[]` is not convertible to `uint16[]`. So if we want to allow the example in the issue, we have to make a more detailed distinction.",

In contrast to other base types there is no way to explicitly convert ``address(0)`` to ``address`` (the non-payable kind), so there is no way to initialize a non-payable address array with a constant address - that's an unnecessary limitation that we could fix by making an exception for ``address payable``-arrays and allowing (implicit) conversions to ``address``-arrays.",
