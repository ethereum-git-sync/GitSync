  "body": "## Abstract\r\n\r\nSolidity currently supports at most one constructor per contract, without overloading; we would like to lift this restriction.\r\n\r\n## Motivation\r\n\r\nIn the same fashion as Solidity support regular function overloading, it would be most useful if it could support constructor overloading as well. This would allow to have multiple initialization paths for the same contract. \r\n\r\nA simple example would be a contract that manages either Ether or an ERC20, so the constructor could accept an address representing the ERC20 contract, while another constructor accepts no parameters and is used for Ether. This can currently be done by assigning a \"special\" address to Ether, but having a separate constructor for a separate path would be much cleaner.\r\n\r\nA more complex example, and the one that motivated this issue, would be allowing contracts to be initialized either in the constructor or on a separate Initialize function. In some scenarios, such as [when creating a delegating proxy to a contract](https://docs.zeppelinos.org/docs/writing_contracts.html#initializers), or [setting up a contract via CREATE2](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-solidity/issues/1651), initialization needs to take place on a separate call to the contract - different to the constructor. Having multiple constructors would allow us to have a constructor with all the initialization logic (used when the contract is deployed regularly), and have an empty constructor that leaves room for a separate `initialize` call (used when the contract is a logic contract backing a proxy, or deployed via create2).\r\n\r\n## Specification\r\n\r\nNo changes are needed when a contract has a single constructor. When it has multiple constructors defined, then a small jump table could be added to the initialization code, and the first argument in the appended contract parameters could be the signature of the constructor to call.\r\n\r\n## Backwards Compatibility\r\n\r\nContracts with a single constructor are unaffected by this change.",

    "body": "> As opposed to function calls, we do not have a notion of function selector for the constructor.\r\n\r\nThat's exactly part of the idea: a function selector could also be added for ctors, and evaluated only on the initialization bytecode. The selector could be calculated as `bytes4(keccak256(\"constructor(uint256,uint256)\"))` (for example), or even removing the `constructor` keyword from the hash altogether (since all functions checked in that step would be constructors).\r\n\r\n> This still requires big changes in tooling which could lead to severe consequences if they are not prepared for it.\r\n\r\nI agree with you here. If a library picks up binary from a contract with multiple ctors and fails to inject the selector, I'm not sure what would actually happen. Perhaps an additional check could be inserted to make sure that deployment consistently fails if a contract is attempted to be deployed without the ctor selector? Could this be detected by checking the length of the arguments somehow - ie multiple of 32 bytes + 4 bytes means selector, just multiple of 32 bytes means no selector? (I'm presuming that ctor arguments are padded to 32 bytes here, which may not be the case).\r\n\r\nA separate discussion is how much you want to slow down improvements on the language because of the tooling around it.\r\n\r\n> Also I think that making init functions a language feature should be a separate issue.\r\n\r\nI'd love to see that!
