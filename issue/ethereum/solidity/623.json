  "body": "Especially in contracts that model a state machine, it would be convenient to group functions that can be called in a specific state. Currently, the modifiers have to be applied to all these functions individually. This enhancement proposes to provide a syntactic means to apply modifiers to several functions at the same time. This does not only apply to modifiers but also to visibility specifiers. Examples:\n\n```\ncontract c {\n   // ...\n  modifier inState(state) { if (currentState != state) throw; _ }\n  using modifier inState(State.transfer) {\n    function f() { ... }\n    function g() { ... }\n  }\n  using modifier inState(State.cleanup) {\n    function h() { ... }\n    function i() { ... }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThis is also convenient to disallow ether transfer using Emmy Noether's famous modifier (derived from Noether's theorem that describes the connection between preservation of ether and the symmetry of the blockchain):\n\n```\ncontract c {\n  modifier noether { if (msg.value > 0) throw; _ }\n  using modifier noether {\n    // put all functions in here that are not supposed to receive ether\n    function f() { ... }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nIf `using modifier x;` (i.e. without curly braces) is used, it applies to the whole contract (including functions before that statement).\n",

    "body": "Modifier areas would be useful in some cases, particularly short, simple contracts. In other cases, though, they would reduce readability, as well as increasing complexity.\n\nSome contracts are large, and would have correspondingly large modifier areas. This means that while reading a function, the `using modifier` declaration could be several pages off-screen. In order to understand the behavior of the function, one would have to scroll up, and keep the `using modifier` context in mind.\n\nAlso, for a contract that has many modifiers, it will be tempting to nest modifier areas, increasing the contract's complexity. It would also be necessary to intersperse inline modifiers with modifier areas, adding to the mental overhead of the contract reader.\n\nUltimately, modifier areas would be a convenience to the writer of the contract, but often a hindrance to the reader.\n",

    "body": "@redsquirrel I think when modifiers are not named a/b but something more concrete, it should quite easily follow which one is the more logical to separate like that. E.g. `isOwner` vs `isState` would be divided by `isState`, and the other would be provided inline. However, it does add some extra thoughts into structuring code. Then again, the gain is to potentially have better structured code and less stacking of modifiers.\n\nIt would be nice to also have multiple modifiers at once:\n\n```\nusing modifiers inState(State.transfer) isOwner() {\n    function f() { ... }\n    function g() { ... }\n}\n```\n\nOtherwise, we might see horizontal space added _and_ vertical space added when going for larger groups (where the gain could otherwise potentially be even bigger, this looks even worse in my opinion).\n\n```\nusing modifier inState(State.transfer) {\n    using modifier isOwner() {\n        function f() { ... }\n        function g() { ... }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nI'm also concerned about the scrolling issue as well, though.\n",
