  "body": "## Abstract\r\n\r\nFunction dispatch should prioritize non-pure functions due to higher on-chain usage. \r\n\r\n<!--\r\nPlease describe by example what problem you see in the current Solidity language\r\nand reason about it.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## Motivation\r\n\r\nPrompted by this [stackexchange question](https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/questions/68098/why-does-adding-a-view-function-make-write-functions-cost-more-gas/68148#68148)\r\n\r\nMost contracts in practice have a high ratio of view/pure to non-pure functions. It is generally seen as \"free\" to add, e.g. a getter for a public variable (deployment cost aside). \r\n\r\nThis has the unfortunate side effect of increasing dispatch costs for non-pure functions that are more gas  sensitive. One solution is to add explicit dispatch priority syntax or optimizer flags ala #4858\r\n\r\nAnother reasonable solution is to have a 2-stage dispatch routine, where all state-modifying functions are dispatched before read-only methods. \r\n\r\n<!--\r\nIn this section you describe how you propose to address the problem you described earlier,\r\nincluding by giving one or more exemplary source code snippets for demonstration.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## Specification\r\n\r\nIn order to maintain compatibility with binary-search dispatch, each binary search `JUMPDEST` is prefixed by a jump to the secondary dispatch table. Lookups that fail (reach the end of their block binary-search block) will then try again in the secondary table.\r\n\r\n## Backwards Compatibility\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nAll language changes that introduce backwards incompatibilities must include a section describing\r\nthese incompatibilities and their severity.\r\n\r\nPlease describe how you propose to deal with these incompatibilities.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis should not cause any backwards incompatibility, but will increase the size of generated bytecode  by at least 1 OPCODE per binary search branch.",

    "body": "One could argue exactly the opposite: view/pure functions are not only called from outside, they may also be called from other contracts. Especially if view/pure functions are part of the deployed bytecode, one could expect that they are only called on-chain - why would they be part of the bytecode otherwise? In that case, such cheap functions should stay cheap. On the other hand, if a function is expensive already, you do not save much by improving the dispatch routine for those functions.",

    "body": "I agree in principle that only code designed to be used on-chain should be used on-chain, but that doesn't seem to happen in practice. It would be interesting to see some sort of separate off-chain code; you could do this by having a function that `delegatecall`s to any address provided by the `0x0` address (which can only be the sender in a simulated call). \r\n\r\nNow that you mention it, in general this 2-level idea could be terrible for e.g. balance getters. There does seem to be demand lately for more flexible dispatch, but OTOH dispatch is a minor cost overall, so optimization is not going to pay off much.",
