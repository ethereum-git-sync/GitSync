  "body": "Currently, the archived binaries of the compiler are only published on github. While this provides a certain protection against manipulation due to the use of git, it is not really in spirit with the decentralisation efforts we are propagating. Also in light of the planned improved [source code verification](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/611), the following changes are proposed:\n- [ ] create a contract on the blockchain that connects\n  - compiler version\n  - \"stability\" (nightly snapshot or release)\n  - sha3 hash of the binary\n  - commit hash of the source code (this will only be partly meaningful until solidity is a fully standalone repository)\n- [ ] create a CI job that performs nightly compilations and automatically\n  - publishes this meta data to the blockchain\n  - pushes the binary onto github\n  - pushes the binary into ipfs (and swarm in the future)\n- [ ] provide a mechanism usable by a set of developer to revoke/update the CI key\n\nEspecially the fact that the sha3 hash of the binary is available to the blockchain will allow contracts to be verified on chain (once we have interactive verification in place), because they can request external entities to execute the binary given by the hash.\n",

If you don’t, you’ll end up spending a lot of time helping people figure out how to rewrite their commits with signed versions. Make sure you understand GPG and the benefits of signing things before adopting this as part of your standard workflow.\r\n\r\nThis wouldn't be a problem for our core team, but we have a lot of external contributions and we probably can't expect all of them to sign their commits. We could look into signing as part of the review process of external contributions (e.g. signing when merging after review), but we'd need to look into how that would affect our workflow (I haven't looked into what that would look like in detail, hence: I'm not sure yet ;-)).\r\n\r\nWe could also consider not signing ``develop`` commits, but only the merges to the release branch, that might be a feasible option as well.",

Enough so that they could read some [basic documentation](https://help.github.com/articles/signing-commits/) and sign their commits.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the day, it is your project.
