Probably better to add an additional method such as `YulOptimizerTest::parseObtainedResult` that looks very much like `YulOptimizerTest::parse` with `s/m_source/m_obtainedResult/` and minus the assignment of resulting ast to private members.\r\n\r\nP.P.S. Doing sanity checking inside YulOptimizerTests is redundant because if a test input results in unparseable AST post optimization, it is going to fail that test (assuming the expectation is correctly encoded which is fair) regardless.",
