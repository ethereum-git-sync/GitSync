  "body": "See this work by Andrew Miller and Zikai Wen (don't know their GitHub usernames):\n\nhttp://hackingdistributed.com/2016/06/16/scanning-live-ethereum-contracts-for-bugs/\n\nThe work-around they recommend is highly unintuitive and seems poorly documented, with the bug affecting a \"majority of smart contracts\":\n\n> We start by trying out our heuristics on the Etherscrape repository of Solidity source code. As of March 20, 2016, the Etherscrape repo contained 361 Solidity contract programs, 56 of which contained a send instruction. Of these contract programs, we’d infer that the majority (at least 36 of 56) do not use either of the defensive programming techniques.\n\nAnd:\n\n> Upon inspection, ***not one of the Solidity programs that passed our heuristic check actually applied the recommended best-practice of testing the callstack directly.***\n\nApparently this bug has caused the loss of thousands of $ worth of ETH already, and therefore seems like something that should receive special attention from the language, perhaps deprecating \"send\" and creating a new language construct for doing it.\n",

(The post authors are myself and @alexwzk)\n\nNote that the underlying problem is also carried over from Serpent, and it's in part a consequence of peculiarities of the EVM itself. https://github.com/LeastAuthority/ethereum-analyses/blob/master/GasEcon.md#hazards\n\nThe Solidity compiler is a great place to put warnings. One option might be to make it an error to use `send()` but ignore the return code. Or to automatically bracket functions with a \"callstack check\".\n\nMaking `send` behave exactly like all the other method calls would at least remove the \"education surface,\" and make it easier for programmers to have correct intuitions about its behavior.\n\nIt would be a also be a good idea to try to address the \"reentrancy\" hazard in the same way, perhaps by providing Solidity support for macros, but I guess that should be a different issue.\n",

I.e. like in Erlang or (maybe) Smalltalk. Am I delusional or is there something there to that idea?\n\nEDIT: copy/pasting addendum from #662:\n\nI.e. in a message-passing model, these types of reentrancy bugs should be impossible, I believe.\n\nThere is just a queue of messages. That's it. No \"function calls\".\n\nThis is what makes Erlang so stable and is also the model that is used by \"latest hotness\" elegant & safe languages like [Elm](http://guide.elm-lang.org/architecture/).\n\nEDIT2: Also, see [Clojure's Agents](https://clojure.org/reference/agents), a variant of the Actor approach.\n",
