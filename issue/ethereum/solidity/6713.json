Might be better to start in SSA form or something like that.\r\nMaybe some more simplification at this stage. Then equivalent function detection. Then inlining again.\r\nThis could potentially solve the precondition modifier case already. But the basic control flow blocks will still potentially be large and it'll be hard to find patterns in them. Also not sure that this is the best structure for common patterns in general - there are potential patterns this will miss by design.\r\nStill not sure about all this in general.",
