    "body": "Fixed point numbers should be ignored.\r\n\r\nIntegers have different bit widths (all multiples of 8 between 8 and 256).\r\n\r\nI don't think you should differentiate between static and dynamic that much. Arrays come in two flavours:\r\n\r\n`<any type>[]` (dynamically-sized array)\r\n`<any type>[k]` (statically-sized array)\r\n\r\nHere, `<any type>` is really anything including arrays, structs, elementary types, ...\r\n\r\nSame is true for structs, a struct member can be any other type. The only restriction is that you cannot use structs that contain themselves (not even via other structs). Another way to explain this is that if you expand the struct meaning that you name the member types directly and also recursively expand members if they are structs, the expansion has to be finite.\r\n\r\nFor mappings, only elementary types are supported as keys. This includes `string` and `bytes`, which are dynamically-sized arrays, but not other arrays. The value type can be anything including mappings, arrays, structs, ...\r\n\r\nThe storage location always applies to a full variable, i.e. you cannot have memory arrays that hold storage arrays or vice-versa. If a mapping occurs anywhere in the type, the whole variable has to be a storage variable and it can only be used in calls to libraries. So perhaps better to omit mappings for not.\r\n\r\nCalldata is a storage location that is only relevant for the called function. To the calling function, these types appear as memory types.",
