But why isn't the following code a way to provide the key for the mapping:\r\n`data[arg1][arg2][arg3].map[arg4]`? for an additional uint arg4 parameter in the function\r\n\r\n4.\r\nIn https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/v0.5.8/contracts.html#fallback-function , the \"A contract without a payable fallback function can receive Ether..\" warning states two ways a contract without fallback function could have received ether. It is missing the third way: pre-funded contract which was sent ether by calculating its address before its creation",

This would serve as another \"thing to remember\" for the reader (2 birds with one stone).",

You have to supply block headers because the contract can only see the last 256 block hashes.\r\n```\r\nin https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/v0.5.8/contracts.html#events is unclear.\r\nSearching google for \"solidity log spv\" gave no clue on this paragraph statement and on how to utilize this log verification or how it is related to blockhash.\r\nThe only related thing was https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/questions/46726/ethereum-account-model-spv-proofs-possible but it spoke about light client implementation and the connection between this and the contract logs is unclear.",
