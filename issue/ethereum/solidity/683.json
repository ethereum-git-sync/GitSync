  "body": "## Summary\n\n`tx.origin` is a security vulnerability, breaks compatibility with other contracts including security contracts, and is almost never useful. Removing it would make Solidity more user-friendly. If there are exceptional cases where access to the transaction origin is needed, a library using in-line assembly can provide it.\n## The Problems\n\n1) `tx.origin` is a security vulnerability. As we [recently saw with the Mist wallet](https://blog.ethereum.org/2016/06/24/security-alert-smart-contract-wallets-created-in-frontier-are-vulnerable-to-phishing-attacks/), using `tx.origin` makes you vulnerable to attacks comparable to phishing or cross-site scripting. Once a user has interacted with a malicious contract, that contract can then impersonate the user to any contract relying on `tx.origin`.\n\n2) `tx.origin` breaks compatibility. Using `tx.origin` means that your contract cannot be used by another contract, because a contract can never be the `tx.origin`. This breaks the general composability of Ethereum contracts, and makes them less useful. In addition, this is another security vulnerability, because it makes security-based contracts like multisig wallets incompatible with your contract.\n\n3) `tx.origin` is almost never useful. This is the most subjective point, but I have yet to come across a use of `tx.origin` that seemed legitimate to me. I welcome counter-examples, but I've written dozens or hundreds of smart contracts without needing it, and I have never heard of anyone else needing it either.\n## Rationale for Removal\n\nSolidity's design philosophy is to prioritize security and reliability over expressiveness. In other cases where behavior is unreliable, Solidity does not expose it. (For instance, there is no way to call an external contract and retrieve the return value if the signature is not known ahead of time.)\n\nThe \"escape clause\" is in-line assembly, which allows the creation of libraries to do anything expressible as EVM assembly. Behavior that is unsafe and unreliable is best kept in libraries, rather than given to all users as part of the core language.\n",

Chances are, there are ways for malicious contracts to do unexpected things by impersonating your users or your contracts. Is it ok if an attacker is able to call any of your functions at any time, with any arguments, while appearing to be a legitimate user? If not, `tx.origin` isn't safe.\n\nAlso consider whether it's ok that your users can't use multisig wallets, and can't be DAOs or anything like that.\n\nIf you're interested, I'd be happy to take a look at your contracts and offer advice for structuring your contracts so you don't need `tx.origin`. I am on a quest to eliminate it from existence!\n",

There will still be a private key somewhere with access to the tokens, which means there's no way to use any other form of security exclusively. If someone gets access to the private key, it's game over. \n\n(It's also just annoying that I have to generate a private key just for your one dapp, rather than using the security system I use for literally everything else.)\n\n> Not sure why EIP 101 should break this?

    "body": "> You may generate a key, create an account, grant account access to any contract you like and immediately destroy the key. \n\nYeah, that works I guess, though you have to hope that you didn't leak the key during the creation and signing phase. Not as secure as I'd like, but not terrible.\n\n> Can you please tell what security system are you referring?\n\nI don't have one set up yet, so I was referring to the hypothetical future. But any security system based on smart contracts, which will be pretty much any of them. For instance, anything with a multisig component, or anything where you can change keys or where you have \"emergency override\" keys. We're building this sort of system at Ownage for our users, and there will be lots more coming out in the near-to-medium-term future. The Mist multisig wallets are a simple example of this pattern.\n\n> EIP 101: Do you mean this change is going to be VM backward incompatible?\n\nWell, it's definitely backwards incompatible (until now all transactions had to be signed in a specific format, after EIP 101 any transaction is potentially valid regardless of signature). But in this specific case, it's not the backwards incompatibility that's the problem, but the general functionality implied by the EIP. Since you can have your \"account\" work based on any code you write, the \"account\" can become the sort of derivative you don't want.\n",
