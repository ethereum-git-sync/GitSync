However there is no mention of tools and configurations of tools that assist in keeping the style the way it should be.  \r\n\r\nAnd it should be noted explicitly that VSCode does this, so someone agnostic to tooling can know to use this tool over some other. \r\n\r\nI know for example `.editorconfig` describes a small part of this. Some environments may need to be told to look at that. \r\n\r\nEven if say VSCode picks this up automatically to set a bunch of its internal configuration parameter, we should write those out in a configuration and make that available explicitly. People who work on other C++ may need to switch back and forth between \"standard\" coding styles and the style be explicit helps those who work among different C++ projects. \r\n\r\n",

    "body": "I  am talking about your internal C++ style and how to set up different programming environments to make it easy to ensure that the house C++ style is maintained.  For example in Emacs [here](https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/IndentingC) is a partial list of formatting styles. Quoting from that: \r\n\r\n* “gnu”: The default style for GNU projects\r\n* “k&r”: What Kernighan and Ritchie, the authors of C used in their book\r\n* “bsd”: What BSD developers use, aka “Allman style” after Eric Allman.\r\n* “whitesmith”: Popularized by the examples that came with Whitesmiths C, an early commercial C compiler.\r\n* “stroustrup”: What Stroustrup, the author of C++ used in his book\r\n* “ellemtel”: Popular C++ coding standards as defined by “Programming in C++, Rules and Recommendations,” Erik Nyquist and Mats Henricson, Ellemtel\r\n\r\nIf for example one of these matches what is used it would be helpful to say that. \r\n\r\nFor vim there might be some other set of settings. For vscode another, eclipse another and so on. \r\n\r\nIn Python there is [blacken](https://github.com/python/black) which will format automatically. Go has gofmt and rust has something as well. If there are formatting tools that are acceptable that might be mentioned. ",
