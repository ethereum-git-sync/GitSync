  "body": "- The repo looks like jsoncpp only receives minimal maintenance.\r\n- The workaround of manually downloading jsoncpp in cmake is evil (we could of course attempt to change that in isolation, but there don't seem to be package updates for jsoncpp e.g. in recent ubuntu either making this a continuing hassle).\r\n- jsoncpp is neither the fastest nor the smallest nor the most conformant option.\r\n- There are a number of pretty much drop-in replacements available.\r\n- We can easily move to a header-only library which pretty much avoids all dependency issues in perpetuity.\r\n\r\nI'd suggest to consider replacing jsoncpp with either http://rapidjson.org/ or https://github.com/nlohmann/json (or any other of the available candidates).\r\n\r\nIs there any reason for staying with jsoncpp other than the required work a move would be (which I wouldn't expect to actually be too bad)?\r\n\r\nCloses #3557.",

Around a year ago I created a branch to replace `jsoncpp` but somehow I never created a PR (https://github.com/aarlt/solidity/tree/nlohmann-json). I don't remember exactly what the state was, but if you would like to replace `jsoncpp` with `nlohmann/json`, I could support you. ",

    "body": "> Regarding comments I'm not sure - should we allow them even though they are actually not valid json? I know that json-cpp only supports them in a weird way as well (whether a comment is fine depends on whether it's key-comment-comma or key-comma-comment, if I recall correctly).\r\n\r\nI would say there is no point supporting comments when they are not a valid JSON feature. IIRC we have them disabled as much as jsoncpp allows disabling them.\r\n\r\nAlso apparently nlohman-json now supports CBOR integration: https://github.com/nlohmann/json#binary-formats-bson-cbor-messagepack-and-ubjson\r\n\r\nThis means we could in theory replace our code or at least replace it in the tests. However this is not a pressing issue as our small CBOR code works well and as intended.",
