One prominent example would be the simplification rule list, which is entirely compile time constant and with a bit of care could be constexpr initialized to a ``std::array`` which could live statically in the data segment. That might especially have beneficial consequences for the emscripten builds and the stack issues.\r\nThere's probably a lot of other places as well.",
