Still trying to figure out what changed between v0.1.0 and v0.2.0/v0.3.0 that leads to this. CC @chfast @axic @chriseth \r\n\r\nThere seem to be other problems in evmone related to the same root cause i.e., code size in create transaction in violation of EIP 170 (24KB). See for example the CI failures in https://github.com/ethereum/evmone/pull/215",
