    "body": "It would also be nice to remove this extra complexity of `Language` and `Machine` in `libyul/AssemblyStack`:\r\n```\r\n        enum class Language { Yul, Assembly, StrictAssembly, Ewasm };\r\n        enum class Machine { EVM, EVM15, Ewasm };\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf we could encapsulate machine/target into dialect, then all we need is a dialect and a translation map. Perhaps having a target and a dialect would be natural as well, but unfortunately there is an overlap between dialects and targets for EVM: EVM15 just specifies a dialect of EVM.\r\n\r\nI would suggest to adopt the \"target triplet\" idea from other compilers (which usually goes as `<machine>-<vendor>-<os>`) and change it to our needs: `<machine>-<dialect>-<subdialect>`, where all fields are lowercase and only `[a-zA-Z0-9_]` are valid symbols. The `subdialect` (and the preceding dash) can be omitted if there's none. I would consider \"yul\" a machine under this.\r\n\r\nRemember, the current configurations in use are:\r\n- Inline assembly (EVM, untyped, default type u256, EVM version)\r\n- Yul (EVM, typed, default type u256, EVM version)\r\n- Ewasm (typed, default type u64, no EVM version)\r\n\r\nWhat we want to support as a minimum (to replicate everything we have currently) is the following:\r\n- `evm-<hardfork>` -- the EVM machine target for a given hardfork\r\n- `ewasm-<hardfork>` -- the ewasm machine target for a given hardfork (and the only supported configuration is `ewasm-byzantium`)\r\n- `evm-eip615` -- machine target for what we call EVM15/EVM1.5 now\r\n- `yul-evm-<hardfork>` or `inlineassembly-<hardfork>` -- the untyped EVM used in inline assembly\r\n- `yul-solir-<hardfork>` -- the Yul Solidity IR for a given hardfork\r\n\r\n",

    "body": "Reading the proposals above I have one question: are there different variants of yul for different hardforks? E.g. all of them just get ``shl`` and the code transform Yul->EVM takes care of it not being an opcode in old EVM versions, doesn't it?\r\nIf so far Yul is the same for all hardforks, can we expect this to be the case in perpetuity?",
