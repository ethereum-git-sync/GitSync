    "body": "I tried to solve the problem with library and struct, however its really hard to came with a better solution. \r\n\r\nThe problem is that EIP 1271 is a contract call and can have an arbitrary lenght signature, and needs to know the message being signed to be validated.\r\n\r\nThe best design would be less efficient then what GnosisSafe have because GnosisSafe decodes and verifies in the same loop, while using a library it would first loop to decode, then after loop around to verify.\r\n\r\nI found out in Solidity it would be possible a library that:\r\n- contains method to decode signatures into ` struct GenericSignature { SigType sigType; bytes sig; }` \r\n- which depending on the SigType could be then decoded into `struct ContractSignature { address validator, GenericSigature[] sigs }`\r\n\r\nI tried doing with only one struct, but nasting structs is only supported for storage. \r\n\r\n@chriseth I think that now that signatures are maturing as EIP:\r\n- consider pick up into the discussion to embrace a pattern of packed appended signatures natively in solidity; \r\n- or in case thats too specific, improve libraries to, similar how is done in js, callback for, in this case, validation to happen inside the same decode loop, so we can implement this as library without being a significant waste of gas.\r\n- or, in case I am not seeing the obvious, enlighten me to the right path.",
