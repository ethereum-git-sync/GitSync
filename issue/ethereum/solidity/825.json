The first four bytes of this are equal to the return value of `methodSignature()` (the method signature of `dummy()`). For some reason, it is returning the method signature.\n\nHere is what I suspect is happening, though I could be wrong though because I don't know the internals of the EVM too well.\n\nWhen `caller()` calls `dummy()`, it has to push the method signature onto the stack. Since `B`'s code is all zeros (since it hasn't been initialised), when it tries to execute, it'll hit `0x00` which corresponds to the `STOP` opcode. When it \"returns\", the method signature will still be on the stack, because it hasn't been cleared by  call to `dummy()`, so `caller()` will read that as the return value.\n\nOf course, in your case, any non-zero value, such as the method signature, will be `true`.\n",

    "body": "Some details are wrong, but I think you're on the right track. \n\nSo when doing a `call`, the evm gets two sets of \"pointers\". The first being [memory in offset, memory in size], which in points to a memory location containing the `calldata` (method signature). And then there's [memory out offset, memory out size]. And that's where the EVM will write the return values. And if there is no return value, the EVM will not touch the [memout - memout+memoutsz] area, leaving it _as is_ . \n\nSo, I guess that Solidity compiler defaults to reusing the `mem_in` - area for output. Which is economically sound (less memory area used == less gas consumed) but becomes very fragile, since the return values depend on the method signature. Fun quirk, actually quite deadly.  \n",
