    "body": "As @axic pointed out, one of the benefits of `override` is that it lets the reader easily know if a function is 'new' or if it's just a definition for an already declared one. It also acts as an assertion that a function is indeed already declared, and prevents errors if the declaration changes on the interface but not on the implementation (making the derived contract abstract).\r\n\r\nHowever, given that we also have `abstract`, I'm not sure this is actually needed. Failing to define a function, including the regression bug I mentioned above, will cause the contract to require the `abstract` keyword, making it obvious something is wrong.\r\n\r\nI'm with @frangio on this one: if we require `override` in these cases, then it becomes very hard for a reader to tell whether a function definition is actually an override, or if it's just the base implementation.",

    "body": "Just to strengthen the case against removing the requirement without any replacement:\r\nSuppose you have two interfaces:\r\n```\r\ninterface I {\r\n  function doImportantStuff(address x) external;\r\n}\r\ninterface J {\r\n  function getSomeData(address x) returns (uint256) external;\r\n}\r\n```\r\nNow consider two parties - one providing a contract library, and the other using it.\r\nInitially the first party writes:\r\n```\r\nabstract contract A is I, J {\r\n  function doImportantStuff(address x, address y) external\r\n  {\r\n    // ...\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nNow you have an auditor confirm that this always does the right stuff. It's a perfectly conformant implementation of I for an implementation of J the user provides. Every conformant implementation of J will get a conformant implementation of I, nothing can go wrong.\r\n\r\nBased on that the second party writes:\r\n```\r\ncontract B is A {\r\n  function validate(address x, address y) public {\r\n    if (/* some involved condition */) revert();\r\n  }\r\n  function getSomeData(address x) returns(uint256) external {\r\n    validate(msg.sender, x);\r\n    return data[x];\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nAnd an auditor confirms: this is fine - ``getSomeData`` conforms perfectly to the requirements of J, this is foolproof.\r\n\r\nBut now there is a fancy third party, providing a cheaper, safer and more feature-rich implementation of ``I``. They write:\r\n```\r\nabstract contract A2 is I, J {\r\n  function validate(address x, address y) public virtual;\r\n  function doImportantStuff(address x, address y) external\r\n  {\r\n    validate(x,y);\r\n    // ...\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nAnd their contracts are audited. It gives you a perfectly conformant implementation of I, if you provide a conformant implementation of J. It is even rumored to be especially safe, since it enforces additional validation.\r\n\r\nNow ``B`` switches from ``A`` to ``A2``. They know their implementation of J is conformant and you know that for every conformant J both A and A2 provide the required conformant I. A2 is cheaper and safer, so why not use that. And you end up with:\r\n```\r\ncontract B is A2 {\r\n  function validate(address x, address y) public {\r\n    if (/* some involved condition */) revert();\r\n  }\r\n  function getSomeData(address x) returns(uint256) external {\r\n    validate(msg.sender, x);\r\n    return data[x];\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nEverything compiles, no reason to doubt this... but you potentially have an utterly broken implementation of the important stuff.\r\n\r\nThat's of course highly artificial and a bit stupid, but I still maintain that allowing to silently implement unimplemented functions *is* dangerous. And there would be no justification to allow it for interfaces, but not for abstract contracts, which increases the problem.",

    "body": "Since we're discussing this again:\r\n\r\nThe example case in which not requiring ``override`` is actually dangerous and can lead to silent unexpected changes in behaviour, if a base interface and a base contract change in a specific way, is only really relevant for overriding unimplemented ``public`` functions. (It relies on some contract calling the unimplemented base function, but it's unlikely to do so externally with an interface function instead of redeclaring the interface function ``public`` and calling it internally.)\r\nGiven that, the actual danger of not requiring ``override`` for interface functions may indeed be minimal (e.g. be the argument that contracts will have to turn ``abstract`` on typos, etc.).\r\n\r\nSo while I personally still think it conceptually makes sense to mark functions overriding interface functions, I'd not object to drop that requirement based on popular opinion :-).",
