  "body": "## Abstract\r\nUpgradegradable proxy contracts that delegate to other contracts (called delegate or logic contracts) for functionality currently have second-class variable storage layout support in Solidity.\r\n\r\nThe problem is that storage variable declarations must match/line up between a proxy contract and all delegate contracts that are delegated to by the proxy contract.\r\n\r\nIn the case of a proxy contract with multiple delegate contracts the delegate contract variable declarations must match up with the proxy contract and with all the other delegate contracts that are used.\r\n\r\nAlternatively, proxy contracts have used unstructured storage which resorts to manually specifying and manipulating storage with assembly.\r\n\r\nSome examples of the proxy contract pattern in use:\r\n1. [ERC1538: Transparent Contract Standard](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1538)\r\n2. [OpenZepplin's Proxies](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/upgrades/2.7/proxies)\r\n3. [AragonOS](https://github.com/aragon/aragonOS/blob/next/contracts/common/DelegateProxy.sol)\r\n4. [Genosis Proxies](https://blog.gnosis.pm/solidity-delegateproxy-contracts-e09957d0f201)\r\n5. [DecentralLand ](https://github.com/decentraland/land/blob/5154046844f6f94a5074e82abe01381e6fd7c39d/contracts/upgradable/DelegateProxy.sol)\r\n6. [EIP1822: Universal Upgradeable Proxy Standard](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1822)\r\n7. [EIP1967: Standard Proxy Storage Slots ](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1967)\r\n\r\nThe proxy contract pattern is used by people and it would be really great if it had first-class variable storage layout support!\r\n\r\n## Motivation\r\n\r\nCurrently the layout of storage variables is documented here: https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/v0.6.3/miscellaneous.html\r\n\r\nI propose that the layout works the same with one change: Instead of starting at position 0 make a keccak256 hash of the name of the contract and start the storage for the contract at the position given by the hash. This way the storage space is separate for each contract that has a different name.\r\n\r\nWith this approach a delegate contract can create its own storage variables without clashing with the proxy contract or other delegate contracts.  And delegate contracts no longer need to import and inherit classes it doesn't need in order to maintain storage variable alignment.\r\n\r\nA syntactic construct can exist for one delegate contract to access the storage specified by the proxy contract or other delegate contract. I propose that a delegate contract simply imports the code of the delegate/proxy its wants to access and then use the contract name to access the contract's storage like this:\r\n\r\n``` Solidity\r\nimport \"./DelegateA.sol\"\r\n// imagine that DelegateA.sol has a storage variable called num2.\r\n\r\ncontract DelegateB {\r\n  uint256 internal num1;\r\n\r\n  // function that returns storage variable data defined within the contract\r\n  function getNum1() external view returns(uint256) {\r\n    return num1; \r\n  }\r\n\r\n  // function that returns storage variable data defined in another delegate contract\r\n  function getNum2() external view returns(uint256) {\r\n    return DelegateA.num2; \r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nThis is the same syntax that is used by libraries, now being used by contracts.\r\n\r\nPerhaps this could be an optional feature that is enabled with a pragma directive. Because this may only be useful for the proxy contract pattern. Also, I am really interested in other possible solutions.\r\n\r\n## Backwards Compatibility\r\n\r\nThis is a not a backwards compatible change. This functionality could be used by new proxy contracts and delegate contracts.  Perhaps, to help with transition, this mode of storage variable layout could have its own pragma directive.",

In my opinion, something like `using storage layout DataDelegateC at keccak256(\"DataDelegateC\");` that applies to the whole contract is too dangerous and too easy to miss. Furthermore, it would be very complicated with regards to inheritance.\r\n\r\nWhat I think could find better consensus is a single state variable (which might be of struct type) that is \"dislocated\". For proxy contracts, wouldn't it even be better if the part needed by the proxy would be dislocated instead of the actual storage? Or is the point that you could move to a different \"fresh\" location when upgrading?",

    "body": "Hi @chriseth.\r\n\r\nThat is a good point about inheritance.\r\n\r\nBeing able to create a dislocated state variable, like how you showed before: `Data data internal at keccak256(\"DelegateB\");` would be very useful for most proxy contracts.\r\n\r\nTo answer your question regarding having a dislocated storage variable or having dislocated storage layouts for proxy contracts,  it depends. There are two different use cases:\r\n\r\n1. A proxy contract that only ever has one delegate/logic contract that it delegates to at a time, so that any upgrade is simply replacing the one logic contract with a different logic contract would benefit the most by using a dislocated state variable like you suggested.  Each logic contract would use the same storage layout so there would be no need for dislocated storage layouts. \r\n2. It is different for proxy contracts that use multiple delegate/logic contracts at the same time. In this case the proxy contract will delegate to a logic contract based on what function is being called. In this approach sharing the same storage layout for each logic contract is a burden, because each logic contract handles different things and does not need to access the same state variables. This approach would benefit a lot if each logic contract could use its own dislocated storage layout space, so that each logic contract is separate from each other but still able to access each other's state variables if needed. Check out ERC1538 for this multiple delegate/logic contract approach: https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1538\r\n\r\nNo matter what having the ability to create a dislocated state variable (such as a struct) is very useful for both approaches. \r\n\r\nThe multiple delegate/logic contract proxy approach would benefit from being able to create dislocated state variable like you mentioned.  Each logic contract could use one or more dislocated state variables for its data.\r\n\r\nI understand that creating dislocated storage layouts for contracts would require more work and greater consensus. But are you able to move forward now in creating what you have suggested to create dislocated state variable, something like this: `Data data internal at keccak256(\"DelegateB\");` ?\r\nBecause I want to start using that in proxy contracts and teaching others about this awesome new capability.",

    "body": "> While this seem like an elegant solution, please note that this addition means either doing an extra round of hashing (and storing the input in the contract) or storing the hash in the contract, both of which are quite expensive.\r\n\r\nThat should no longer be true after #11026. If the key is known at compile-time, the compiler should be able to pre-compute the values, right?\r\n\r\n> I propose that the layout works the same with one change: Instead of starting at position 0 make a keccak256 hash of the name of the contract and start the storage for the contract at the position given by the hash. This way the storage space is separate for each contract that has a different name.\r\n\r\nThis topic was brought up on the chat yesterday and I think it's something users can already do without any new syntax. The example from https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/8353#issuecomment-589249774 could be written like this:\r\n```solidity\r\ncontract DelegateB {\r\n    struct Data {\r\n        uint a;\r\n        uint b;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    mapping (string => Data) delegateData;\r\n\r\n    function data() internal view returns (Data storage) {\r\n        return delegateData[\"DelegateB\"];\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    function doSomething() external {\r\n        data().a = 8;\r\n        data().b = 7;\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nYou can have multiple delegate contracts, each with its own different `Data` struct. Each delegate has to define the `delegateData` mapping separately as the first storage variable so that these mappings share the same storage location. The thing about mappings is that they reserve a slot in the contract but that slot is unused. Its only purpose is to distinguish between different mappings - it's used as salt when computing storage locations for keys. Each delegate gets a deterministically assigned storage location for its struct (only depends on the key) and as long as the key stays the same, you can upgrade the delegate and have it keep its storage.\r\n\r\nThe only thing you cannot do without inline assembly is accessing the data of a different delegate - each `Data` struct is different so you can access delegate's key in `delegateData` but it will have wrong type.\r\n\r\nIf this pattern is enough, then we could consider introducing some syntax sugar for it:\r\n```solidity\r\ncontract mapping DelegateB {\r\n    uint a;\r\n    uint b;\r\n\r\n    function doSomething() external {\r\n        a = 8;\r\n        b = 7;\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nThis `contract mapping` would generate the code equivalent to the previous example. The key would be just the name of the contract (maybe qualified with source unit name, though this might be problematic given how different frameworks handle paths differently) and each derived contract would get a separate key and a different `Data` struct. Hiding the mapping and not allowing other \"top-level\" state variables has the nice benefit of preventing people from adding stuff outside of the `Data` struct and unintentionally breaking the pattern, which can easily happen if you implement this pattern manually.\r\n\r\nIt's fully backwards-compatible because `contract mapping` would be a new thing, not affecting how `contract`s work.\r\n\r\nIf we wanted to allow accessing storage of different contracts, we could also go for a different syntax:\r\n\r\n```solidity\r\ncontract DelegateA {\r\n    zone {\r\n        uint c;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    zone {\r\n        uint a;\r\n        bytes b;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    zone SharedDelegateData {\r\n        uint x;\r\n        bytes4 y;\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\ncontract DelegateB {\r\n    zone SharedDelegateData {\r\n        uint x;\r\n        bytes4 y;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    zone {\r\n        uint a;\r\n        uint b;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    function doSomething() external returns (bytes4) {\r\n        a = DelegateA.c;\r\n        return y;\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nEach unnamed storage \"zone\" would internally get an index and its mapping key would be a concatenation of contract name and that index. But index would not be necessary to access it. Names across all zones in the same contract would have to be unique so you could access them using contract name.\r\n\r\nA named zones would get a key that depends only its name. Such zones could be used to deliberately share storage locations with other contracts. They key could also have some domain-separated suffix to ensure that they never conflict with unnamed zones based on contract names. Named ones give some more flexibility but they will also get out of sync much easier so we could also only allow unnamed zones. \r\n\r\nI would disallow mixing zones and normal state variables, though technically it should be entirely possible to allow that.",

    "body": "Hi, thanks for the call out @mudgen.\r\n\r\n@cameel, If you're interested I can comment on some of the points you've brought up.\r\n\r\nSTL;DR\r\n\r\nUnstructured storage powerful. Language limits exercising power. Give us more power.\r\n\r\nTL;DR\r\n\r\nBeing able to dynamically define storage pointers for variables has expanded my ability to write more flexible contracts. Main issues have come from structs not having a standard way to identify them that is inherent to their code, like `interfaceId` for interfaces. I have to go through a lot of work to write code to ensure it's all being done in a consistent way. Language and compiler support would make this a lot easier, can could standardize the usage.\r\n\r\nBUT, still allow for developer defined storage pointers so we can manipulate them as needed. So possible an addition to instantiating structs to let us set the storage pointer at the start.\r\n\r\nPromoting structs to a type, somehow, seems like the optimal solution. Baring limitations, as writing compilers is beyond me.\r\n\r\nP.S.\r\n\r\nAll this is really only relevant in the context of dynamic proxies as this whole option facilitates being able to use `delegatecall` dynamically based on mapping transaction properties to target addresses. And that is limited due to the inherent surcharge. So, really, this would be most beneficial if something can be done about the surcharge for using external libraries so we can leverage this further. Which would have the side effect of potentially reducing chain size as we wouldn't need to deploy as much redundant code to get around the surcharge.\r\n\r\nPontification Mode Active /\r\n\r\nI agree that a storage pointer standard should rely on an inherent property of the struct to minimize any human errors from having an arbitrary definition. I've settled on using this to calculate my storage slots.\r\n\r\n`bytes32 private constant STORAGE_SLOT = keccak256(type(ServiceProxyStorage).creationCode);`\r\n\r\nWhere the storage library code consists of\r\n\r\n```\r\nlibrary ServiceProxyStorage {\r\n\r\n  struct Layout {\r\n    mapping(bytes4 => address) serviceForFunctionSelector;\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  function _layout(bytes32 slot) pure internal returns (Layout storage layout) {\r\n    assembly{ layout.slot := slot }\r\n  }\r\n  \r\n}\r\n```\r\nThe default storage slot is defined and used in a library where I implement the desired CRUD operations for the struct defined in the storage library.\r\n\r\nBy using the creation code for the struct defining library I can ensure the default slot is intrinsic to the definition of the struct. By including a function that effectively casts a storage pointer to the struct i also provide an option to define a different slot if needed.\r\n\r\nI've settled on defining structs in libraries with their `_layout` casting function. Implementing the CRUD functions in a library where I can actually access the creation code of the struct definition library. And then using that CRUD library in an abstract contract to define the \"business logic\" for a contract as an atomic unit of functionality using only internal functions. Then expose those internal function with a contract that only implements external functions and a constructor if needed.\r\n\r\nWith that background out of the way, It would be helpful if struct could have implicit properties, like how interfaces have selector properties, or like `type` offers. Then we could have an inherent identifier to use when dynamically defining storage slots. Maybe there's something available in the ABI encoder when it's encoding structs for passing between contracts that could give that inherent identifier?\r\n\r\nAlso, one point I didn't explain on why I implement my storage usage as I do is that I do have times where I don't want to use the default storage slot. So I made sure to leave the ability for me to reuse my struct definitions, and CRUD libraries with a different storage slot. An example of how I use these libraries in an abstract contract is here.\r\n\r\n```\r\nfunction _setOwner(\r\n    address owner\r\n  ) internal {\r\n    OwnableLib._layout(OwnableLib._getDefaultSlot() )._setOwner(owner);\r\n }\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe CRUD library exposes a `_layout` function that passes through to the struct defining library to facilitate loading the right struct without the contract inheriting the abstract having to know anything about the underlying structs or their usage. Which helps maintain a separation of concerns between the presentation layer and the internal logic. So I'm kind fo treating the storage pointer like a database connection, and my struct and CRUD libraries like database driver libraries.\r\n\r\nSo, it would be nice to also have an option when instantiating a struct to define its storage slot so we don't have to go through all these hoops, and can eliminate the usage of assembly to access the `slot` property of a storage variable.",

    "body": "Another matter I've been considering is the potential benefit of including a modifier when calling a function using an interface to designate that a `delegatecall` should be used. I was thinking of 3 options, again, no idea how it might be best to implement. just examples to explain the idea.\r\n\r\n`IContract(address).delegate.externalFunction();`\r\n\r\n`IContract(address).externalFunction{delegate}();`\r\n\r\nor maybe\r\n\r\n```\r\ndelegate{\r\n  IContract(address).externalFunction();\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nEither way, I raise the point here as I see the primary usage of unstructured / dynamically assigned storage being to facilitate using `delegatecall` by resolving the storage slot expectation mismatch problem. So it might be relevant when considering a storage slot standard.\r\n\r\nAlso, it does work to use external libraries as the implementation for a proxy. It might be appropriate to tie this to the relevant library when it's external. If there is some way to introduce an externally accessible contract metadata system that would work for libraries, then the blockchain could build up a standard set of available data types and logic accessible more easily, and reliably. Like how ERC165 was baked into the compiler.\r\n\r\nBut all of this might not be very useful since we don't have true polymorhpism and reflection in the EVM. But from some experimentation, I think it would be possible to realize fuller functionality. The reflection could be handled with a contract metadata standard baked into the compiler so developer can more easily expose those properties to other contracts.\r\n\r\nAnd with a standardized set of external libraries, we might be able to leverage more implementations like in ERC1167. Making it possible to store parts of a contracts bytecode, and compose them with external libraries so developers wouldn't need to write as much code. And users could know that proven,, immutable code was being reused from the blockchain. Almost making it possible to treat the blockchain like a byte code file path for loading the relevant libraries. Which might make it possible to implement a declarative framework for Solidity that will handle composing the appropriate bytecode based on deployed external libraries declared like dependencies.\r\n\r\nSomething like\r\n\r\n```\r\nimport <ERC20 Mintable Library Address>\r\n\r\n@ERC20Mintable{\r\n  name: \"Token\",\r\n  symbol: \"T\",\r\n  decimals: 18,\r\n  totalSupply: 1000**decimals\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen the compiler can check the metadata for the library address, like the interface ID and function selectors, and compile bytecode similar to ERC1167 mapping the library function selectors to the library address in the new proxy. Using a standardized storage slot for the function to library mapping that could be overriden if needed. So, just like being able to drop down to assembly, developers could opt to drop down to base Solidity when they need to do something that isn't already available. But a reverse lookup system could be implemented to make it easier to find available external libraries to import. Treating libraries on chain like packages. And this could then be extended so part of a contract's metadata would be able other contracts that it's dependent upon. So if other libraries need to be included they can be pulled in as more mapped functions in the new proxy. Which means it might be possible to actually find implementations you can import using just the interface id for the functionality you want.\r\n\r\nI'm not really capable of writing a compiler, far too rusty. But I was meaning to try implementing a declarative build tool to trial this idea. Initially writing it all as a Hardhat plugin that would start by including my repo as the available libraries, and use my on-chain proxy factory system to identify available modules and simply deploy a proxy using those already deployed contracts. Then see if I can figure out the bytecode to handle it with a more direction insertion by splicing the strings resulting in immutable proxies created at deployment. Then there simply wouldn't be any actual source code. just declarations and bytecode that handles the `delegatecall` to the library for that function.",

    "body": "@mudgen @cameel \r\n\r\nThanks for such a great discussion. I also am arriving on this and love the topic. \r\n\r\nBelow is @cameel 's example. \r\n\r\n```js\r\ncontract DelegateB {\r\n    struct Data {\r\n        uint a;\r\n        uint b;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    mapping (string => Data) delegateData;\r\n\r\n    function data() internal view returns (Data storage) {\r\n        return delegateData[\"DelegateB\"];\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    function doSomething() external {\r\n        data().a = 8;\r\n        data().b = 7;\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nI don't understand how good this way can be when there's only proxy and only one logic contract at any time. Let's say for the proxy contract, first version was `DelegateB` contract above.   You all know how variables and values will be stored in this case. let's say `a=10, b=20`. Time for the update. So we write new `DelegateC` contract and the main point is I should not be forced to append variables in the struct, if I am forced, then what's the point of this pattern in the first place ? So new `Data` gets changed to\r\n\r\n```js\r\nstruct Data {\r\n    uint k; // NOTE: we put this in the beginning.\r\n    uint a; \r\n    uint b;\r\n }\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf the key in the mapping stays `DelegateB`, we are screwed as collision happens (`k` gets put in the same slot as `a` ), so we gotta change the key as well to `DelegateC`. Now, we are safe because collisions don't happen, but we got another problem. Since new key appeared in the mapping,  if we do `delegateData[delegateC].a`, we won't get the value of `a`, which I really need otherwise, what's the point of upgrade ? the point of upgrade is i change state variables, add some features, but I also need to know the values of old variables, otherwise state is lost. Okay, so the way of solving this is that in the new upgraded contract `DelegateC`, I should start writing/using `delegateData[delegateB]` alongside `delegateData[delegateC]`.  And the story will go on and on. In the new updated version - `delegateD` contract, I would need to use `delegateData[delegateB], delegateData[delegateC] and delegateData[delegateD]` all three. So changing orders of variables or their types, this pattern doesn't seem to work. \r\n\r\nam I missing something ? \r\n",
