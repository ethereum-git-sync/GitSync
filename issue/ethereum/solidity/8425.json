  "body": "Currently, within solidity code, any reference to a storage pointer is considered ``view``. However, there if there is actually no access to storage, but merely the storage slot is read, it could be considered ``pure``, e.g.\r\n```\r\ncontract C {\r\n    uint256[] s;\r\n    function f() internal pure returns (uint256[] storage c) {\r\n        c = s;\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nis currently invalid, but could be valid. This is especially interesting, since we allow assembly access to storage slots in pure functions already, so the following is already allowed:\r\n```\r\ncontract C {\r\n    uint256[] s;\r\n    function f() internal pure returns (uint256[] storage c) {\r\n        assembly { c_slot := s_slot }\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n",

    "body": "After discussing some aspects of this with @hrkrshnn I'm actually not sure anymore that this can be done in a reasonable way. We need to distinguish the following:\r\n```\r\nuint256[] s;\r\nfunction f(uint256[] storage x) internal pure returns (uint256[] storage) {\r\n   return x;\r\n}\r\nfunction g() internal pure {\r\n   s;\r\n}\r\nfunction h() internal pure {\r\n   f(s);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nFrom these:\r\n```\r\nuint256[] s;\r\nfunction f(uint256[] storage x) internal view returns (uint256[] memory) {\r\n   return x;\r\n}\r\nfunction g() internal view {\r\n   uint256[] memory c = s;\r\n}\r\nfunction h(uint256[] memory) internal view {}\r\nfunction i() internal view {\r\n   h(s);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nI.e. the change between view and pure occurs in implicit type conversions... catching that would make the ViewPureChecker significantly more complex... is there sufficient gain in making the accesses to only the slot pure to justify this? @chriseth\r\n",
