We ask only that you do your best to provide as much information as possible so we can better help you.\r\n- Support questions are better asked in one of the following locations:\r\n\t- [Solidity chat](https://gitter.im/ethereum/solidity)\r\n\t- [Stack Overflow](https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/)\r\n- Ensure the issue isn't already reported (check `feature` and `language design` labels).\r\n\r\n*Delete the above section and the instructions in the sections below before submitting*\r\n\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## Abstract\r\nCurrently `abi.encodePacked` adds padding to arrays.  `abi.encode` can be used for that.\r\n\r\nPlease change `abi.encodePacked` so that it returns bytes of arrays without padding. I ran into a situation where `abi.encodePacked` would have been really useful if it did not pad arrays with zeros.\r\n\r\nIt would be great if the following was true:\r\n```Solidity\r\nuint8 value1 = 1;\r\nuint8 value2 = 2;\r\nuint8 value3 = 3;\r\nuint8[] memory threeValuesArray = new uint8[](3);\r\nthreeValuesArray[0] = value1;\r\nthreeValuesArray[1] = value2;\r\nthreeValuesArray[2] = value3;\r\n\r\nabi.encodePacked(value1, value2, value3) == abi.encodePacked(threeValuesArray)\r\n``` \r\n\r\n<!--\r\nPlease describe by example what problem you see in the current Solidity language\r\nand reason about it.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nIn this section you describe how you propose to address the problem you described earlier,\r\nincluding by giving one or more exemplary source code snippets for demonstration.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThe technical specification should describe the syntax and semantics of any new feature. The\r\nspecification should be detailed enough to allow any developer to implement the functionality.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nAll language changes that introduce backwards incompatibilities must include a section describing\r\nthese incompatibilities and their severity.\r\n\r\nPlease describe how you propose to deal with these incompatibilities.\r\n-->",
