    "body": "Thanks for your suggestion, @Amaxx! I'm wondering whether you really need a data structure that support \"partial evaluation\" or if what you really need is tuples as keys for mappings.\r\n\r\nSo it would rather be\r\n```\r\nmapping(bytes32, bytes32, bytes32, uint256 => MyEntry) internal m_lookuptable;\r\n```\r\n\r\nand you would use `m_lookuptable[\"1\", \"2\", \"3\", 1]` instead of  `m_lookuptable[\"1\"][\"2\"][\"3\"][1]`\r\n\r\nIt would also have the benefit that you only need to compute one hash instead of 4.",

    "body": "Btw @Amxx, it occurred to me that you can (almost) already do this albeit at a memory cost: can use a single `bytes32` key and hash your keys (`keccak256(abi.encode(a, b, c,...))`). With `bytes.concat` (#10903) this should be clarified to `keccak256(bytes.concat(a, b, c, ...)`.\r\n\r\nSo basically the tuple syntax is a memory-efficient and more easy to ready alternative to the above.\r\n\r\nWe should keep in mind that potentially the codegen should be able to avoid the memory overhead, if it is clever enough.",
