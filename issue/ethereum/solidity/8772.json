  "body": "Currently in the ABI there are two kinds of \"bytes\" types: fixed-length bytes (1 to 32 bytes, `bytes1` to `bytes32`) and dynamic-length bytes (`bytes`).\r\n\r\nThere is a reason for this: since the ABI operates on 256-bit width elements, fixed-length bytes can be encoded in-place, while dynamic ones are encoded as an offset in-place and followed by 256-bit aligned data.\r\n\r\nHowever, in many of the use cases, contracts use dynamic bytes *only* because they need a longer than 32-bytes field, but they don't expect that field to be dynamically sized. Therefore they resort to introducing `require` statements to ensure the inputs are of valid size. I expect these use case to increase in numbers with the BLS12-* curves picking up users (since they have larger keys).\r\n\r\nThus here is a proposal to introduce language support for this: `bytes(N)` marks fixed-size, but dynamically encoded fields. The ABI decoder would check and reject input at the time of decoding.\r\n\r\nAlternatively we could accept arbitrary length (N) as a keyword `bytesN`, but that I think would introduce too much complexity on the parser.\r\n\r\nQuestion: is the `bytes(N)` syntax too confusing? Any other ideas?\r\n\r\nExample use case (syntax 1):\r\n```solidity\r\ninterface IDepositContract {\r\n    function deposit(\r\n        bytes(48) calldata pubkey,\r\n        bytes32 withdrawal_credentials,\r\n        bytes(96) calldata signature,\r\n        bytes32 deposit_data_root\r\n    ) external payable;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nExample use case (syntax 2):\r\n```solidity\r\ninterface IDepositContract {\r\n    function deposit(\r\n        bytes48 calldata pubkey,\r\n        bytes32 withdrawal_credentials,\r\n        bytes96 calldata signature,\r\n        bytes32 deposit_data_root\r\n    ) external payable;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nExample use case (syntax 3):\r\n```solidity\r\ninterface IDepositContract {\r\n    function deposit(\r\n        bytes{length=48} calldata pubkey,\r\n        bytes32 withdrawal_credentials,\r\n        bytes{length=96} calldata signature,\r\n        bytes32 deposit_data_root\r\n    ) external payable;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis could potentially also help the SMTChecker, at least there would be no need for extra require statements from the user.",

    "body": "Alright, nice, if we're open to break the current ``byte[N]``syntax  in solidity, then so far I'd vote for doing that! In case we agree on that, there's a few things to iron out, though... should we keep ``bytes1..bytes32``? Do we need that for the ``bytes1[N]`` workaround to get the old behaviour? Could that instead be ``byte[1][N]``? Will we support ``byte[N] x = 0x12...FF`` for ``N > 32`` and with longer literals? Will ``byte[]`` replace ``bytes``? And not sure that's even all questions :-).",

    "body": "In terms of the ABI, is there a reason for limiting the size of fixed-size byte arrays?\r\n\r\n> However, in many of the use cases, contracts use dynamic bytes only because they need a longer than 32-bytes field, but they don't expect that field to be dynamically sized. Therefore they resort to introducing require statements to ensure the inputs are of valid size. I expect these use case to increase in numbers with the BLS12-* curves picking up users (since they have larger keys).\r\n\r\nIt seems like developers would be better off using fixed-size byte array fields larger than 32 bytes here.\r\n\r\n> Alternatively we could accept arbitrary length (N) as a keyword bytesN, but that I think would introduce too much complexity on the parser.\r\n\r\nIn Fe, we currently [allow for this](https://github.com/ethereum/fe/blob/974efcf59c30c056ea4e65161695866fe2cdb51c/compiler/tests/fixtures/guest_book.fe#L1) and encode the data as a fixed-size value. I actually wasn't aware of the size limitation until very recently. Our tests weren't even failing because the [library](https://github.com/openethereum/ethabi) we're using for encoding/decoding values ignores this part of the spec.",

The change means that the lowest 8-16bits of the storage key (the input to `SLOAD`/`SSTORE`) would not be hashed, and consecutive keys are laid out next to eachother.\r\n\r\nIt would be nice for contracts to make use of this. Luckily [it seems](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.4/internals/layout_in_storage.html) that value types and static-length arrays would already benefit from this change, as they are consecutively stored. Dynamic types, including `bytes` and `string`, would not benefit.\r\n\r\nHowever the type discussed in this issue could be stored like static arrays and allowing to benefit from this new storage scheme.",
