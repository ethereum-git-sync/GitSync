    "body": "> * Rename `New Issues` column on the [old board](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/projects/43) to `Triage` and start adding new issues there for now until we figure out if we can do it for the focus board.\r\n\r\nI made a simple workflow to move new issues to triage in the old project board: https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/13528\r\n\r\nI saw that you created a `Solidity triage` board. What is the purpose of that board?\r\n\r\n> As for new boards, looks like PAT seems to be the only way forward and we do want to move on to them if only because github is very likely to deprecate old ones at some point. So once devops creates a custom account for us, we could move on with that.\r\n\r\nYes, using a PAT with organization permission to the `Solidity Focus` or `Solidity triage` board, we can concentrate all issues on the same board by just adding the automation in both repos. A GH app also works, we only need to install it on both repos, or install the app in the org with permission to both repos.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
