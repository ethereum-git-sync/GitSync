  "body": "This is a proposal to extend the \"using for\" directive in the following ways:\r\n\r\n - allow it at file level to be valid for all contracts and functions in that file\r\n - allow its first argument to be a free function\r\n - allow its first argument to be an imported module\r\n - allow its first argument to be `*`\r\n\r\nThe semantics are as follows:\r\n\r\nThe directive `using * for ...` matches all free functions in the current file (including non-scoped free functions imported from somewhere else), but it does not match functions in libraries or functions imported scoped into a module (`moduleName.functionName`).\r\n\r\nThe directive `using functionName for ...` matches the specified function. Here, `functionName` can be a path like `moduleName.functionName`.\r\n\r\nThe directive `using moduleName for ...` matches all free functions in the imported module (via `import \"fileName\" as moduleName`) including free functions imported from that module at file level. Here, `moduleName` can be a path like `moduleA.moduleB`.\r\n\r\n\r\nNote that most of the new uses are incompatible with flatteners.\r\n\r\n---\r\nUpdate (2021-09-20):\r\n\r\nExtend the `using A for B` statement everywhere to allow `A` to also be\r\n - a list of file-level functions in curly braces.\r\n - the name of a module\r\n - a single file-level function\r\n - `*`\r\n\r\nIf used at file-level, `B` cannot be `*`.\r\n\r\nIf used at file-level also allow `export using A for B`, when `B` is a type declared at file-level in the current file.\r\n\r\nClarification: In the above, all \"items\" can be paths (`A.B.f`) and don't have to be single identifiers.",

    "body": "I wanted to address one point from today's call: while doing `using x for y` separately for every function might be a bit verbose I think it does have some advantages over binding all functions from a module wholesale.\r\n\r\nThis is very similar to imports in Python where importing every name separately is in fact the recommended style. So this:\r\n``` python\r\nfrom math import abs, sin, ceil;\r\n```\r\nis recommended over this:\r\n``` python\r\nfrom math import *;\r\n```\r\n[Wildcard imports are actually frowned upon](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2386714/why-is-import-bad).\r\n\r\nWith fine-grained imports you don't pollute the namespace with names you're not going to use (which helps avoid collisions) and they make it very straightforward to trace the source of every name in the file without having to refer to any other files. It seems like something that would be helpful when auditing. It's also something I loved when I switched to Python from Ruby which does not have these fine-grained imports and it can be very hard to find the definition of something. I'm missing it a bit in C++ too.\r\n\r\nSolidity is not Python, the circumstances are a bit different (contracts are not full applications and are therefore short; also new definitions can't be added dynamically at runtime) and the scale is smaller (it's not about all imports, just bound functions) but I wanted to add another perspective on this. For some people (including me) importing things one by one may actually be the more natural way to use this feature.",

    "body": "Question brought up by @hrkrshnn : How to handle mixed-type operators for user-defined operators:\r\n\r\nApart from exceptions like `<<` and `**`, the compiler-supplied operators always only handle a single type. I think to prevent complications, we should do the following for user-defined operators:\r\n\r\n- each operator can only be named once for a type in a using statement (or all using statements combined), and you cannot use `*` in combination with operators.\r\n- the signature of functions like `add` in the above example has to be `add(MyFixed, MyFixed) ...` (it can be non-pure and it can return a different type)\r\n- the identifier has to be unique (cannot used function overloads)\r\n- the type (`MyFixed`) cannot be a built-in type.\r\n\r\nThe operator is resolved as follows: In `x + y`, the compiler first checks if the type of `y` is implicitly convertible to the type of `x`. If this is true, the `using` statement is looked up and the return type and pureness is determined from the function. If it is not implicitly convertible or if no operator matches, the compiler checks if the type of `x` is implicitly convertible to the type of `y`. If yes, it looks up the operator for the type of `y`.",

    "body": "Yet another alternative - which is way more permissive and maybe also achieves the same goals and is more consistent with how `using` works currently:\r\n\r\nThere can be only one `using` statement at file-level, but operators can be named multiple times and function names can resolve to multiple identifiers. Operators can neither be used with a `using` statement for built-in types nor with `*`.\r\n\r\nFor each `x + y` in the code, the matching set of functions according to the following rule has to contain exactly one element:\r\n - consider all `using` statements for the (mobile) type of `x` and the (mobile) type of `y`. Restrict to the given operator. Iterate through all functions the names resolve to and add them to the set if the parameter types match after an implicit type conversion.\r\n\r\nWe can ignore \"built-in\" operators because `using` cannot be applied to built-in types.",

    "body": "I'm not sure about allowing mixed types. Consider `type Timestamp is uint` and `type Duration is uint`. If we allow a `+ :: Timestamp -> Duration -> Timestamp`, the expression `t + d + d` may be somewhat confusing: `(t + d) + d` is well-defined, whereas `t + (d + d)` is not. (Here `d + d` is not defined.) This can be even more problematic if the operator `+ :: Duration -> Duration -> Duration` is defined, making `(t + d) + d` and `t + (d + d)` evaluate to do different timestamps.\r\n\r\nThe problem is that the current syntax hides away all these complexities. For example, the operations may be non-commutative. Or how associativity of operators isn't well specified, which can affect the final value or introduce ambiguity during parsing.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nA second problem with the using syntax is that it doesn't allow easy extension into unchecked block. I think some form of traits, without mixed types, may be better. Here's a rough syntax:\r\n\r\n```\r\ntype UFixed18 is uint256 with Add, UncheckedAdd;\r\n\r\ninstance Add(UFixed18) {\r\n    function add(UFixed18 a, UFixed18 b) public returns (UFixed18 c) { ... }\r\n}\r\ninstance UnCheckedAdd(UFixed18) {\r\n   function add(UFixed18 a, UFixed18 b) public returns (UFixed18 c) {unchecked{ ... }}\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis still doesn't make any guarantees about commutativity of `UFixed18` or associativity. So `a + b + c` is again ambiguous.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nAnother approach is to allow defining global infix operators similar to free functions (and disallow redefining existing operators).\r\n\r\n```solidity\r\ntype UFixed18 is uint256;\r\ninfix function <*>(UFixed18 a, uint b) returns (uint) { ... }\r\n\r\nuint constant a = UFixed18.wrap(25) <*> 50;\r\n```\r\n\r\nMaybe a stricter definition that allows specifying the precedence as a number, as well as associativity to resolve parsing ambiguity. Something similar to what [Haskell](https://bugfactory.io/blog/custom-infix-operators-in-haskell/) already does.",

I think this pattern should be discouraged.\r\n\r\nI'm generally in favour of operators, but allowing mixed operators for `*, +, /, -, ==` etc does not sound safe. \r\n\r\nCustom operators (which can be mixed) surprisingly solve this problem:\r\n\r\n```solidity\r\ninfix function <*>(UncheckedInt a, int b) returns(Unchecked c) {...}\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow for `a <*> b * c`, only `a <*> (b * c)` is well-defined. The other expression, i.e., `(a <*> b) * c` doesn't type check, since there is no `* : UncheckedInt -> int -> UncheckedInt` defined. Similarly, for the expression `a <*> b <*> c`, only `(a <*> b) <*> c` is well-defined.",

    "body": "@hrkrshnn wanted to know hy `using {f, h} for MyType globally` or `export using...` should not also be available it contract level. \r\nAs currently planned, `using ... globally` is only allowed at file level in the same file (and scope) where the type is defined and you can only use library functions or file-level functions. The reason is that these library functions and file-level functions can be called from everywhere. If we allow `using ... globally` inside a contract, then it would suggest that you can also use internal functions of that contract inside the contract. This would prevent the function to be called everywhere. Example:\r\n\r\n```\r\ncontract C {\r\n  struct S { uint x; }\r\n  using {f} for S globally;\r\n  function f(S memory) internal { ... }\r\n\r\n  function g() public returns (S memory) { ... }\r\n}\r\n\r\nfunction t(C c) {\r\n  // since the using statement above uses `globally`, the member is available on `S`\r\n  // here. So you should be able to call c.g().f(), but you cannot because it is an internal\r\n  // function of the contract.\r\n  c.g().f();\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nI think only allowing file-level (and library) functions for using statements at file level is the simpler and saner approach.\r\nI would actually lean towards not modifying the syntax and semantics of the using statement inside a contract at all and maybe also deprecating it over time.",

    "body": "EDIT: [this wasn't entirely thought through]<details>\r\nThinking about it, I'm not so sure the whole \"export using\" or \"using.. globally\" stuff is a good idea...\r\n\r\nI'd do the following:\r\n  - All using statements always ever only extend to their syntactic scope period.\r\n  - On each type definition we can immediately add functions to the type using a different mechanism, for example:\r\n    ``type UncheckedInt is int with {f};`` - for structs maybe even just as ``struct S { uint x; function f() ... }`` or also with ``with`` or some keyword.\r\n  - Only those functions declared directly together with the type are available everywhere where the type is available. Extending this set of functions later on is impossible.\r\n  - In situations in which I *want* to extend a type with more global functions, I simply define a new type that inherits all functions of the old type, make the type implicitly convertible and add more functions in the process (all of which we'd of course have to allow).\r\n\r\nThe result is a situation in which you can:\r\n  - explicitly extend any type for your current scope without affecting anything or anyone else\r\n  - have well-defined types with well-defined interfaces that do not depend on scope or the like at all\r\n  - still have extensible types with implicit conversions\r\n\r\nAnd I avoid to have weird implicit scoping effects and strange behaviour due to diamond-like cross-importing exported using statements on the same types and all such issues that will come up eventually with exporting ``using``...\r\n\r\nEDIT: Ok, I missed the fact that the intention was to only allow ``using...globally`` in the same file/scope as the type declaration...\r\n</details>",
