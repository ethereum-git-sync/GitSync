  "body": "## Introduction\r\n\r\nWe, Nomic Labs, have been working on identifying which metadata should `solc` emit as part of the compilation process to:\r\n\r\n1. Make existing tools less fragile\r\n    - Many tools depend on `solc` implementation details which are not considered part of of the compiler API. This leads to some of them breaking with new `solc` releases, degrading the users' experience and imposing high maintenance costs.\r\n2. Make creating new tools easier\r\n    - Creating tools that analyse Solidity requires knowledge of the internals of the compiler today. Some of them are documented, some of them aren't. This has a very steep learning curve. Having metadata explicitly designed for tool developers would lower it.\r\n3. Make new kinds of tools possible\r\n    - Giving new metadata can unlock the construction of new tools that are now impossible or require too much effort to be viable.\r\n4. Give the compiler more flexibility\r\n    - With better metadata, tools won't have to rely on `solc` compilation details. This will give the compiler more freedom to change things without breaking external tools, as long as the metadata is general enough and up-to-date.\r\n\r\nTo do this, we analyzed the current situation and gathering feedback from different teams that would benefit from this effort. You can read more about this [here](https://www.notion.so/nomiclabs/Solidity-debugging-symbols-requirements-gathering-128849a840f241388219c56e7e91281d).\r\n\r\nOnce that data was collected, we presented an initial proposal, which is available in this other [Notion document](https://www.notion.so/nomiclabs/Solidity-debugging-symbols-Initial-proposal-b70fedc2c7914498bd7ed8e27db63883).\r\n\r\nSo far, most communication was handled on a Telegram group, but I'm creating multiple issues to move it here.\r\n\r\nThis issue in particular is meant to continue the discussion related to metadata for **local variables**.\r\n\r\n## Identifying and decoding local variables\r\n\r\n[This document](https://www.notion.so/nomiclabs/Local-variables-symbols-Initial-proposal-7a317eb434204d43b7dc86e250700400) contains all the relevant information of the proposal and has been updated today (2020-07-21), so that also includes answers to all the questions that were made about it so far.",
