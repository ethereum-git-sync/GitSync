  "body": "## Introduction\r\n\r\nWe, Nomic Labs, have been working on identifying which metadata should `solc` emit as part of the compilation process to:\r\n\r\n1. Make existing tools less fragile\r\n    - Many tools depend on `solc` implementation details which are not considered part of of the compiler API. This leads to some of them breaking with new `solc` releases, degrading the users' experience and imposing high maintenance costs.\r\n2. Make creating new tools easier\r\n    - Creating tools that analyse Solidity requires knowledge of the internals of the compiler today. Some of them are documented, some of them aren't. This has a very steep learning curve. Having metadata explicitly designed for tool developers would lower it.\r\n3. Make new kinds of tools possible\r\n    - Giving new metadata can unlock the construction of new tools that are now impossible or require too much effort to be viable.\r\n4. Give the compiler more flexibility\r\n    - With better metadata, tools won't have to rely on `solc` compilation details. This will give the compiler more freedom to change things without breaking external tools, as long as the metadata is general enough and up-to-date.\r\n\r\nTo do this, we analyzed the current situation and gathering feedback from different teams that would benefit from this effort. You can read more about this [here](https://www.notion.so/nomiclabs/Solidity-debugging-symbols-requirements-gathering-128849a840f241388219c56e7e91281d).\r\n\r\nOnce that data was collected, we presented an initial proposal, which is available in this other [Notion document](https://www.notion.so/nomiclabs/Solidity-debugging-symbols-Initial-proposal-b70fedc2c7914498bd7ed8e27db63883).\r\n\r\nSo far, most communication was handled on a Telegram group, but I'm creating multiple issues to move it here.\r\n\r\nThis issue in particular is meant to continue the discussion related to metadata for **mapping keys**.\r\n\r\n## Identifying and decoding mapping keys\r\n\r\n[This document](https://www.notion.so/nomiclabs/Mapping-keys-symbols-Initial-proposal-092be64f8bc14c80a0728f713004c2b8) contains all the relevant information of the proposal and has been updated today (2020-07-21), so that also includes answers to all the questions that were made about it so far.",

    "body": "I'm copying this section of the document here so that it doesn't go accidentally ignored.\r\n\r\n@chriseth, I believe this contains answers to all the questions posted on the Telegram group.\r\n\r\n## Jul 21 Updates\r\n\r\nThis comment contains answers to different questions about this proposal:\r\n\r\n### What does *tracking* mean in this document?\r\n\r\nDetermining the complete set of mapping keys used by a contract can't be determined statically. In order to do so, you need to identify when they are used and store that information. This is what we call *tracking* a key.\r\n\r\nAs explained below, identifying the uses of every mapping key, is a complex and recursive task. To be able to identify some mapping keys, you may need to have already identified others, that's the reason for naming this *tracking*.\r\n\r\n### What information is needed for each mapping?\r\n\r\nTo be able to effectively track the mapping keys used by a contract, we need these things:\r\n\r\n- Be able to identify when a key is being hashed without false positives.\r\n- We need to know every mapping's key and value types.\r\n- We need to know every slot that identifies a mapping.\r\n- We need to know the layout of the memory buffers that are hashed when computing keys.\r\n    - Currently, this layout is always the same.\r\n- We need to know how each type is represented in the memory buffers that are hashed when computing keys.\r\n    - For example, the `string` representation in these buffers doesn't match its storage representation.\r\n- We need to be able to identify when a dynamic array's size changes.\r\n    - See below to understand why this is needed.\r\n\r\n### What would happen if `sha3` instructions get reused by non-mapping-keys code?\r\n\r\n**Extended question:** As mentioned by Chris, a future version of the compiler may decide to reuse the same `sha3` instruction for mapping keys and non-mapping-keys code. In theory, it could even decide to emit a single `sha3` instruction. How would this be handled?\r\n\r\n**Answer:** As mentioned above, tracking mapping keys requires identifying when a key is being hashed without false positives. We envision two ways of doing this:\r\n\r\n- Statically: by somehow indicating that a portion of the bytecode is exclusively used for hashing mapping keys. In our proposal, this means tagging `sha3` operations.\r\n    - Pros:\r\n        - Requires no modification to the bytecodes emitted today, just metadata.\r\n        - Simpler to consume. No need to inspect the runtime state to tell if an instruction belongs to a mapping or not.\r\n    - Cons:\r\n        - It inhibits some optimizations, as a single `sha3` instruction wouldn't be enough for certain programs. Note that two would though, as one can be used for hashing mapping keys, and the other for everything else.\r\n- Dynamically: by emitting code that flags when a `sha3` instruction is being used for a mapping key, for example, by setting a well-known memory address to `true`, or pushing it to the stack.\r\n    - Pros:\r\n        - More flexibility for the compiler to optimize use of `sha3` instructions.\r\n        - May make building certain unrelated optimizations easier, by not requiring tracking the `sha3` metadata.\r\n\r\n    - Cons:\r\n        - This approach would slightly increase runtime gas costs.\r\n        - Requires modifications to the bytecodes being emitted.\r\n\r\nGetting back to the question, if an optimization of this kind were implemented, a new static or dynamic way of identifying the mapping-related `sha3` instructions should also be implemented.\r\n\r\n### Detailed explanation of how the metadata proposed here would be used\r\n\r\nThe way we envision this being used looks like this:\r\n\r\n1. You need to keep track of all the mappings, which can be identified by their slots, during the whole execution of a contract. By tracking here I mean having a list or set of currently existing mappings and their types. By execution of a contract, a single EVM message, not previous ones.\r\n\r\n2. Right before the execution starts you need to populate this set of mappings with the ones that are present in the storage layout, and any possible mapping that's accessible from dynamic arrays.\r\n\r\n3. Whenever a dynamic array's length slot is written, you need to update the list/set of mappings, adding or removing some of them. The reason for this is that arrays can include mappings and structs containing mappings.\r\n\r\n4. When a `sha3` instruction marked as a mapping key computation is executed, you need to inspect the memory to get the slot of the mapping. This slot should belong to a mapping that is already being tracked, so you can get its type and decode the key.\r\n\r\n5. If a mapping that contains mappings or structs containing mappings is accessed, the \"child\" mappings must also be tracked.\r\n\r\n### Inline assembly storage allocation\r\n\r\nStorage being allocated using inline assembly is out of the scope of this proposal.\r\n\r\nA new proposal can be presented for this particular use case of inline assembly, but we don't consider it a high priority, as allocating storage using inline assembly is only done by very advanced users of the language.\r\n\r\n### Storage pointers\r\n\r\nThis proposal doesn't include information about storage pointers/references. Those are included in this other document: [Local variables symbols: Initial proposal](https://www.notion.so/Local-variables-symbols-Initial-proposal-7a317eb434204d43b7dc86e250700400)",

    "body": "\r\n> If you have mappings of mappings, this is probably impossible.\r\n\r\nI disagree, since any nested mappings has to be accessed in order (for example in a `mapping(uint => mapping(uint => uint))` in order to access the inner mapping, a sha3 must be done first in the outer mapping to know the resulting slot, where the inner mapping is located. If a process is tracking this along the trace of the transaction is pretty easy to identify that slot as a mapping when it re-appears again in a sha3 instruction as the base of a mapping. With more complex structures (such as nested mappings and arrays and structs) some more calculation has to be done to account for offsets but is pretty straight forward.\r\n\r\n> Does this mean that you need to know the bytecode offsets of the .push() functions?\r\n\r\nNot necessarily. This depends on the implementation of the tracker. One option is to traverse the layout each time a `sha3` mapping instruction is found in order to check where the slot in the sha3 is coming from. When traversing the layout, you will note the length of a dynamic array every time, so there is no need to even tack it. Another option is to have pre-arranged ranges of slot that the program is remembering to what variables they are associated with, in this case it is needed to update these ranges when a dynamic array size changes, however there is no need for extra metadata here at the moment as you can also save the position of the lengths of dynamic arrays and updated them before computing the slot for the sha3.\r\n\r\n",
