    "body": "Immutables end up as in-line litterals. The on-chain byte code and cost for the following `foo` functions are _identical_:\r\n\r\n```\r\ncontract ImmutableTest1 {\r\n    function foo() external pure returns (uint256) { return uint256(4); }\r\n}\r\n\r\ncontract ImmutableTest2 {\r\n    uint256 internal constant _foo = uint256(4);\r\n    function foo() external pure returns (uint256) { return _foo; }\r\n}\r\n\r\ncontract ImmutableTest3 {\r\n    uint256 internal immutable _foo;\r\n    constructor() { _foo = uint256(4); }\r\n    function foo() external view returns (uint256) { return _foo; }\r\n}\r\n\r\ncontract ImmutableTest4 {\r\n    uint256 internal immutable _foo;\r\n    constructor(uint256 foo_) { _foo = foo_; }\r\n    function foo() external view returns (uint256) { return _foo; }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThere 4 `foo` functions are as pure as anything else that we have defined as pure in solidity.\r\n\r\nIn #992, you state:\r\n\r\n> \"the keyword pure is introduced for functions, they are view functions with the additional restriction that their value only depends on the function arguments. This means they cannot use SSTORE, SLOAD, cannot send or receive ether, cannot use msg or block and can only call other pure functions.\"\r\n\r\nThus, by that definition, the above 4 contracts all have pure `foo` functions.\r\n\r\nIt hurts no one to allow pure functions to contain immutables, and only results in objective technical accuracy, rather than subjective semantics.\r\n\r\n> \"pure implies \"can be computed without knowing only the source code\".\"\r\n\r\nCan you point me to where this is defined anywhere in Solidity/EVM literature or among Solidity developers? This is honestly the first time I ever hear of this.\r\n\r\nPure implies that the output is dependant without any state, other than the functions themselves.",

    "body": "> Pure implies that the output is dependant without any state, other than the functions themselves.\r\n\r\nExactly that is what it is. In the [example](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/9554#issuecomment-959275861) the value of the immutable depends on the blockchain state. A copy of the contract deployed at a different time will have a different value. The idea of a pure function is that if you compile it again and put it in a different contract, it will return the same value, which it does not if it accesses the immutable in the example above.",
