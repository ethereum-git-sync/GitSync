    "body": "Good point :-). But that change in 0.6.12 was rather a code generation optimization - so you're right, the compiler now actually evaluates keccak256 during code generation, but that's \"too late\"...\r\nSo this issue is a special case of the more general problem, namely, that this works:\r\n```\r\ncontract C {\r\n    uint256 constant x = 3 + 1;\r\n    function f() public returns (bytes32) {\r\n        assembly {\r\n            let y := x\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nwhile this doesn't:\r\n\r\n```\r\ncontract C {\r\n    uint256 constant x = uint256(3) + uint256(1);\r\n    function f() public returns (bytes32) {\r\n        assembly {\r\n            let y := x\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n(the latter is not evaluated *early* enough, even though after optimization you'll likely still have ``4`` in the bytecode when referring to ``x``, i.e. it's still *eventually* evaluated during optimization...)\r\n\r\nSo I still think the most general solution to this would be to implement https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/3157 - but we could also think about introducing a special case for string-literal-keccak256 earlier than that, since that's a likely use for constants...",
