  "body": "## Description\r\n\r\nDuring deployment of Augur, one of the contracts would not verify on Etherscan properly: the deployment process created one bytecode for \"ZeroXTrade\", while giving the Standard Json to Etherscan and having them compile created bytecode with VERY slightly different bytecode  (of different lengths!).\r\n\r\nDue to past issues with contract verification, Augur flattens all contracts prior to deployment. The Standard Json that is provided to solidity lists many contracts to be compiled, but all of them are completely flattened and self-contained (with significant code-duplication between them).\r\n\r\nThe issue is that the bytecode created for a self-contained contract changes depending on what OTHER self-contained contracts are compiled at the same time. In the example below, I have linked two different inputs that are identical except for an additional self-contained contract being compiled at the same time which demonstrates this issue.\r\n \r\n## Environment\r\n\r\n- Compiler version: 0.5.17\r\n- Target EVM version (as per compiler settings): 0.5.17\r\n- Framework/IDE (e.g. Truffle or Remix): n/a\r\n- EVM execution environment / backend / blockchain client:\r\n- Operating system: Linux\r\n\r\n## Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\nstandard-json examples that show the issue:\r\n\r\nhttps://gist.github.com/epheph/20428a1ff7163bce1d47be7d7b623344\r\n\r\nThe only difference between these two files is the \"Augur.sol\" section (which jq is discarding the output of).\r\n\r\nIf you run each of these through solc 0.5.17:\r\n```\r\n$ cat 1-contract.json  | solc-0.5.17 --standard-json \\\r\n      | jq -r '.contracts[\"trading/ZeroXTrade.sol\"].ZeroXTrade.evm.bytecode.object' | egrep -o '^.{64}'\r\n60806040526000805461ffff1916905534801561001b57600080fd5b506147c2\r\n\r\n$ cat 2-contracts.json  | solc-0.5.17 --standard-json \\\r\n     | jq -r '.contracts[\"trading/ZeroXTrade.sol\"].ZeroXTrade.evm.bytecode.object' | egrep -o '^.{64}'\r\n60806040526000805461ffff1916905534801561001b57600080fd5b506147d1\r\n```\r\n\r\nLook at the last characters, `c2` vs `d1`. There are many other slight differences, but this is the first.\r\n\r\nZeroXTrade.sol makes NO reference to Augur.sol, so the fact that Augur.sol is compiled in the same solidity run should not change the ZeroXTrade's bytecode.\r\n\r\n/cc @nuevoalex\r\n",

I believe our new compilation pipeline can easily trigger this bug. \r\n\r\nHere's an example of what we were planning to do, and why it would fail:\r\n\r\n* Suppose you have files `A.sol`, `B.sol` and `C.sol`. `B.sol` imports `A.sol`.\r\n* Starting with a clean project, you'd compile `A.sol`, `B.sol` and `C.sol` together. \r\n* Then, you modify `B.sol` and it gets compiled alongside `A.sol`.\r\n* The user then deploys each a contract from `B.sol`, and forgets to verify it, nor is willing to commit the compilation output to git. Note that this is **extremely common**. I can't stress enough how common this is.\r\n* For some reason, like migrating to another pc, the project's cache/artifacts get cleared.\r\n* The user now wants to verify the contract from `B.sol`, so they compile the project. i.e. `A.sol`, `B.sol` and `C.sol` together.\r\n* `B.sol`'s output may be different, and if so, the verification would fail.",

    "body": "Leaving a note here that this affects Argent wallet contracts that are on solc 0.6.12 and using `ABIEncoderV2` pragma. When compiling these as part of the overall set of contracts they generate different bytecode than when compiled on their own. Example bytecode differences for `ApprovedTransfer` contract:\r\n\r\nCompiled as part of larger contracts set\r\nhttps://gist.github.com/elenadimitrova/9073bc073ee72a7264cafe2982823f6b#file-approvedtransfer_bytecode_compiledwithall\r\n\r\nCompiled alone\r\nhttps://gist.github.com/elenadimitrova/4f58d3795d009a05be2c2f56ca77d97c#file-approvedtransfer_bytecode_compiledalone\r\n\r\nAffected contracts are: `ApprovedTransfer`, `TokenExchanger`, `TransferManager`, `LimitStorage` and `RelayerManager`. \r\nBy compiling `ApprovedTransfer` and `RelayerManager` independently we've managed to produce the same bytecode as Etherscan for verification however this wasn't successful for `TransferManager` and `TokenExchanger` contracts which makes me think there is a larger issue here. I'd like this issue to be reopened and addressed as part of an update to 0.6 (as it is not an issue with 0.7).",
