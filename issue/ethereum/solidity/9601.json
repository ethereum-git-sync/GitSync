It's still some improvement.\r\n\r\nBut, it would be best to just change it in both cases to `-2**255`/`2**255`. Unless there's some technical reason preventing this - I haven't really looked at the current implementation yet so there might be something I'm not aware of.\r\n\r\nAlso note that after implementing it you should update expectations in tests because that's where these numbers are used currently. But don't do it manually - you can just run `isoltest` and accept the changes it proposes (see [Writing and Running Syntax Tests](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/contributing.html#writing-and-running-syntax-tests) in the docs in case you haven't yet).",
