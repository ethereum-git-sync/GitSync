This sparked some ideas about how it could be used.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n1. Replace `returns` with`->`:\r\n\r\n```\r\nfunction approve(uint amount) -> (bool) external pure {}\r\n```\r\n\r\nSide comment:\r\n> Perhaps grouping the input and output and then having specifiers follow is more readable. Though one could argue that some specifiers (such as modifiers) logically belong before the output declaration as they are \"processed” before the output is returned.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n2. Use it in function types\r\n\r\n```\r\nfunction (uint, uint) returns (uint)`\r\n```\r\nwould be reduced to\r\n```\r\n(uint, uint) -> (uint)\r\n```\r\n\r\n@ekpyron pointed out:\r\n> `function (uint, uint) -> (uint) public x;`... is the state variable public or the function type?\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n3. Use it for lambdas:\r\n\r\n```\r\nlambda min = (uint, uint) -> (uint) { }\r\n```\r\n",
