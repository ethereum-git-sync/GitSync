    "body": "Here's the gist of my discussion with @ekpyron on Gitter:\r\n\r\nThe reason that the stack compressor and the `g` and `fDnTOc g` parts are hard-coded is that it's just final cleanup and we don't want them to disappear when we use a sequence produced by yul-phaser. This part is not meant to be evaluated using the same criteria as the rest of the sequence (i.e. just taking the size of the resulting code into account).\r\n\r\nIf Stack Compressor is safe to use at arbitrary points in the sequence (it does not have to be effective but must not crash the compiler), it could be assigned a letter and treated as any other step. I just didn't see any practical need for doing it like that and decided to keep it simple. It would need a tiny wrapper to make it accept the same parameters as other steps and the phaser would also need a special case to ignore the Stack Compressor step. Then the hard-coded part could be made a part of the main sequence.\r\n\r\nWe would just need to document that the cleanup part and the compressor should be included when using a custom sequence. Or, for better usability, it might be best to have two separate options: one to change the first part of the sequence (meant to optimize size) and the other to change the final cleanup. It would make it easier to override one without having to change the other. Having phaser actually treat it like two sequences and use different criteria is actually something that came up in my discussions with @chriseth while I was working on it.\r\n\r\nSo implementing it is not a problem, it's just a matter of deciding how configurable we want/need it to be.",

    "body": "So as for some more guidance:\r\nWe currently have the command line option ``-yul-optimizations steps`` and the standard json option ``optimizerSteps`` (in ``settings.optimizer.yulDetails``) which determines the sequence of yul optimizer steps to be run. The default is defined in ``OptimiserSettings::DefaultYulOptimiserSteps`` in ``libsolidity/interface/OptimiserSettings.h``.\r\nThe sequence is actually run in ``OptimiserSuite::run`` (``libyul/optimiser/Suite.cpp``).\r\n\r\nYou'll see in ``OptimiserSuite::run``, however, that we also have hardcoded parts.\r\nThe initial sequence ``\"hgfo\"`` is fixed and cannot be changed, since it creates the standard form of Yul that's a prerequisite for all optimizer steps.\r\nHowever, for the \"cleanup\" sequence ``\"fDnTOc g\"`` (line 142), it makes sense to make it configurable as well.\r\n\r\nSo the task is to add a separate option, resp. a way to change, that cleanup sequence.\r\n\r\nFirst thing to do would be to add a field for that in ``OptimiserSettings`` with the appropriate default.\r\nThen we'll need to decide how to set them from the outside in the CLI and standard json interfaces (I'm sceptical about a full new CLI option for it and am considering introducing a separator in the current option to split off the cleanup sequence, but I'd like @cameel's input on that).\r\n\r\nThere's one part of the cleanup sequence that will have to remain hardcoded, that's the \"g\" in the end.

    "body": "@cameel, as discussed with @ekpyron, one of the things we'll disallow is custom cleanup sequence in nested sequences, i.e. a sequence such as `dhfo[Dg:vu]lfnTUtnIf` would be illegal, as we only want to see the `:` delimiter at nesting level zero. However, should we allow the delimiter to be placed at the beginning, or at the end of a sequence, thus making either the optimizer sequence or cleanup sequence empty? E.g., would these be OK: `:dhfoDgvulfnTUtnIf` or `dhfoDgvulfnTUtnIf:`?\r\n",
