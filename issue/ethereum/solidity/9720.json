    "body": "Here's what I think we should do for this issue:\r\n1) Update our scripts and cmake config to treat the file with a placeholder the same way as if the file did not exist at all. Do not try to get the right value automatically when the file is being read and do not fill out the template automatically outside of `git archive`.\r\n    - This way anyone just checking out the repo and building without touching these files will still get the same behavior as now (i.e. always a pre-release build).\r\n2) Provide a script that gets the right values and fills out the templates.\r\n    - Users can easily run it to get a release build after checking out a tag.\r\n3) (Optional) Provide a [`post-checkout`](https://git-scm.com/docs/githooks#_post_checkout) hook so that it's easy to have your repo configured for git to run the script automatically on every checkout. The thing with hooks is that they are not installed automatically when you clone a repo. So I'd do it like this:\r\n    - Create the hook in `scripts/git-hooks/post-checkout`. The hook should simply call the script from (2).\r\n    - Create a script called `scripts/install_git_hooks.sh`. It would copy this hook (and any other hooks we decide to add in the future) to the hook dir (i.e. the dir returned by `git rev-parse --git-path hooks`).",

    "body": "So after extensive discussion with @cameel I think we arrived at the following conclusion regarding the prerelease logic:\r\n\r\n- We create a ``prerelease.txt`` file in the repository, but not in the repository root. I suggest ``cmake/prerelease.lock``. The contents can be something like ``If this file is present, a prerelease will be built by default. You can override this with cmake options ...<mention cmake options below>...``\r\n- We use [export-ignore](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-archive#Documentation/git-archive.txt-export-ignore), s.t. this file will not be part of the github source archive.\r\n- If  ``cmake/prerelease.lock`` exists, we build a prerelease by default, so ``cmake/scripts/buildinfo.cmake``\r\n   sets ``SOL_VERSION_PRERELEASE`` to ``develop.<date>``.\r\n- If  ``cmake/prerelease.lock`` does not exist, we build a release by default, so ``cmake/scripts/buildinfo.cmake`` sets ``SOL_VERSION_PRERELEASE`` to empty.\r\n- If an old-style ``prerelease.txt`` file exists in the repository root, we raise a fatal cmake error, explaining the new mechanism.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, we want to provide cmake options to override this default behaviour:\r\n\r\n- We provide a new cmake string option ``SOL_PRERELEASE_STRING`` which can be used to override the prerelease string, i.e. the value of ``SOL_VERSION_PRERELEASE`` in ``cmake/scripts/buildinfo.cmake`` (i.e. if ``SOL_PRERELEASE_STRING`` is non-empty, we use its content as ``SOL_VERSION_PRERELEASE``)\r\n- We provide a new cmake boolean option ``SOL_FORCE_RELEASE`` to force a release build (empty ``SOL_VERSION_PRERELEASE`` in ``cmake/scripts/buildinfo.cmake`` even if ``cmake/prerelease.txt`` exists). If this option is true, ``SOL_PRERELEASE_STRING`` needs to be unset/empty.\r\n- We use the cmake string option ``SOL_COMMIT_HASH`` to replace the `commit_hash.txt` file we've been using so far. If ``SOL_COMMIT_HASH`` is non-empty, we use its content and ignore the file, otherwise, if the file exists and actually contains a commit hash, we use that hash. Otherwise we set it to the default value.\r\n\r\nWhen it's done:\r\n- Document the new cmake options under [Building from Source](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/installing-solidity.html#building-from-source). Also include a note explaining how the mechanism worked until now.\r\n- Remember to update CI and scripts to use the new mechanism.\r\n\r\n**EDIT by @cameel**: Updated with my suggestions from the chat.\r\n**EDIT by @cameel**: Renamed all options to use `SOL_` prefix (rather than `SOLC_`). I noticed that the original description was mixing these two and having both `SOL_COMMIT_HASH`and `SOLC_COMMIT_HASH` at the same time is just asking for bugs.\r\n**EDIT by @cameel**: Changed the part about `commit_hash.txt`.",

    "body": "> I'm somehow wondering whether we could achieve this without having any magic files like `cmake/prerelease.lock`.

Having this file is the only way we came up with so far to have the source result in a release build automatically. This is because `git archive` used by Github lets us skip files from it but not add them.\r\n\r\n> That means all dependencies should be either included (I think it's not possible, e.g. to always include all boost stuff), or a t least listed in a format, so that an enduser can automatically install them.\r\n\r\nIf they're missing, they get downloaded automatically by cmake. See [`jsoncpp.cmake`](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/develop/cmake/jsoncpp.cmake) and [`range-v3.cmake`](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/develop/cmake/range-v3.cmake). Which is exactly why no one noticed so far that ranges-v3 was not included in the old archive.\r\n\r\n> Maybe we could use something like [`vcpkg`](https://vcpkg.io/en/index.html) to manage those dependencies better.\r\n\r\nThere's an ongoing discussion on this: https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/8860#issuecomment-932787258. No consensus so far though. Last time I asked, @chriseth was not convinced that introducing such a system for managing dependencies is an improvement over just keeping dependencies to a minimum. And others have varied opinions.",

Somehow I forgot that we have still our build system present in the tarball ;) \r\n\r\nHowever, I think we don't really have boost managed, and also not z3, right? Both depend on the version installed on the system. I think it would be great to have those also managed by us. I think that would be a point for moving forward with something like `vcpkg`.\r\n\r\n",

Here's a summary of what we agreed on:\r\n- Building a release must be automatic. Change the rules as follows:\r\n    - If `.git` directory exists and we're on a tagged commit, it's a release\r\n    - If `.git` directory exists and we're not on a tagged commit, it's a pre-release\r\n    - If `.git` directory does not exist and `commit-hash.txt` contains an actual commit hash, it's a release.\r\n    - Otherwise, report an error.\r\n- We do want the overrides (forcing a release build, setting pre-release string and overriding the commit) but they should be used sparingly. With the automatic mechanism they should rarely be needed even in our CI.    \r\n    - To make the PR simpler we can drop `SOL_FORCE_RELEASE` and `SOL_COMMIT_HASH` options (only keep them as variables as they were until now). The magic files are enough.\r\n    - We still need `SOL_PRERELEASE_STRING` option for setting the value for the pre-release string.\r\n        -  It's an error to use it in a release build.\r\n- Source archives need to be tested. We should have at least one job that builds from the source archive. (#12900)",
