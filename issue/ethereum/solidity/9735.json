It precisely enforces the programmer to be explicit, it's not a choice.\r\nSimilarly, disallowing `this` in free functions and forcing the programmer to pass it via argument enforces explicitness.\r\n\r\n> In addition, different programmers have different styles and abilities and knowledge.\r\n\r\nOf course, in the same way that different languages are more permissive or stricter.

    "body": "> I don't think that function mutability/visibility limits much what a programmers does.\r\n\r\nBut in the same vein passing `this` via a parameter does not really limit you either. It just requires you to be explicit about the fact that your function needs to access the contract instance. There are languages that require you to do this all the time - e.g. Python where every instance method has `self` as the first parameter. You also have to do it in Solidity with libraries and `using for` (the instance needs to be the first parameter). Honestly, I find this style more readable than the implicit `this` in other languages.\r\n\r\nAnother thing is that like @leonardoalt said, a function is not associated with any specific contract - so what type would `this` have? To make it work the compiler would either have to erase the type or generate a copy of the function code for every type behind the scenes. And it would be confusing to the programmer because now the type of `this` depends on the context in which the function is called rather than where it is defined. JavaScript does this and it's in my opinion one of the more confusing features of the language (the whole prototypal inheritance is).",

Isn't that the same situation where this is not associated with any specific contract?\r\n\r\nIf a contract calls an internal library function, `this` represents that contract. But in this use case `this` is pretty much neutered. I'm not sure if you can actually do anything more than cast it to an address (`address(this)`) .You definitely can't call other external functions from the same library via it. You also can't refer to contract's functions and storage variables that way. That's why there are no issues with its type.\r\n\r\nIf you meant it that way then yeah, it would be technically possible to make the address available via `this` in internal functions but I don't think it's worth it just to save some typing. The less stuff is magically available globally, the better in my opinion. Free functions are a new construct so expectations are different and it's a good opportunity to clean it up a bit.",

Having `this` available everywhere and making it work the same way everywhere makes the language easy to understand and use.   I've never had a problem with `this` being available. Solving problems that exist in theory but not in practice may create problems in practice.  \r\n\r\nI am leery of developers of tools who don't actually use those tools to make and maintain real word applications in production. Though I realize that sentiment may be impractical or unfair.\r\n\r\nI am for adding new useful functionality but I'm not for removing currently useful functionality that breaks the consistency and mental modal of the languages unless the changes create a new and better consistency and mental model and is more useful or convenient and safe.\r\n\r\nIn practice the magically available variables have been very convenient and useful and haven't caused me problems.

If that's enough for you and you feel very strongly about it, then I think that adding it is not out of the question. But right now the sentiment is slightly against it so you'd just need to somehow show in a compelling way that it's better than just keeping the status quo.\r\n\r\nHere's another perspective: part of the reason behind not feeling compelled to make free functions a 1:1 equivalent of libraries is that we think that libraries as a feature came a bit short of solving the issues they were meant to solve. Free functions are a new construct and perhaps a chance to improve on that. Consistency is good but sticking to bad choices for the sake of it isn't necessarily good. `this` is a pretty minor difference so we might remove it but I think that keeping free functions and library functions fully equivalent is not something we want to commit to in general.",

    "body": "> Maybe it would make sense to also disallow them making external calls, or at least adding a keyword that tells if they can make external calls (and thus forward ether from the contract).\r\n\r\nWe discussed this on today's call and came up with two potential solutions:\r\n1. Following #9248 introduce the `mutable`/`mutating` mutability keyword. Such free functions allow external calls, others not. Not sure about sending ether.\r\n\r\n2. Since storage can only be modified via passing in storage references, a similar explicit method for function calls could be passing in function type pointers.\r\n\r\nExample for 2):\r\n```solidity\r\ncontract C {\r\n  function adjust(function (uint a, uint b) returns (uint) add) returns (uint) {\r\n    return add(1, 2);\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nI think this mostly depends on coming up with a nicer syntax for function types tbh (see #9616).",
