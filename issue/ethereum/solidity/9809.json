    "body": "a) sounds good.\r\n\r\nWith b), which one do you mean (I'd assume option 1 but `figure out what kind of test it is` suggests something more complex, like in option 2):\r\n1. Accepting a path to the test relative to the current dir so that instead of\r\n    ```bash\r\n    isoltest --test=syntaxTests/array/concat/bytes_concat_*.sol\r\n    ```\r\n    you could do just\r\n    ```bash\r\n    isoltest bytes_concat_*.sol\r\n    ```\r\n    as long as you're already inside `syntaxTests/array/concat/`?\r\n\r\n    This sounds like something nice to have, though I'm not sure how useful it would be in practice (for example I rarely `cd` into test dirs, not sure about other people). It would make it a clear distinction between files and test names though.\r\n\r\n2. Or maybe that\r\n   ```bash\r\n    isoltest bytes_concat_*.sol\r\n    ```\r\n    would just figure out where tests matching `bytes_concat_*.sol` are located and act as if you specified the whole path, regardless of where you are in the filesystem?\r\n\r\n    This would be definitely more useful though you can already do something close:\r\n    ```bash\r\n    isoltest --test=*/bytes_concat_*\r\n    ```\r\n    With `soltest` too, but there you have to know exactly how deeply the file is nested:\r\n    ```bash\r\n    soltest --run_test=*/*/*/bytes_concat_*\r\n    ```\r\n    You cannot specify the file extension here but doing a) would make it possible.",
