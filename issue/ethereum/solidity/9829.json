  "body": "Exchanging data with contracts is a crucial feature, which has been mostly covered by the ABI and hidden by the language with decoding and encoding done opaquely. Various constructs, such as proxies and layer-2 solutions, demand more control over the data, and as a result new functionality was introduced to widen the control for the users: `abi.encode`, `abi.encodePacked`, and `abi.decode`.\r\n\r\nImportant to note that `abi.encode`/`abi.decode` operate on the \"non-packed\" ABI encoding specification, while `abi.encodePacked` allows for a [weird ruleset of packed encoding](https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/v0.7.0/abi-spec.html?highlight=abi.encode#non-standard-packed-mode).\r\n\r\nThere have been several requests for more flexibility for decoding, including `abi.decodePacked`, which due to the ambiguity of the encoding cannot be done.\r\n\r\nI propose to take a cue from other languages and consider the widely used pack / unpack functions:\r\n- Python packing: https://docs.python.org/2/library/struct.html\r\n- Ruby packing: https://apidock.com/ruby/String/unpack\r\n- Lua packing: http://www.inf.puc-rio.br/~roberto/struct/\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nIntroduce two functions:\r\n1. `pack(<format>, <values>...) -> (bytes memory data)`\r\n2. `unpack(<data>, <format>, <types>...) -> <variables>...)`\r\n\r\nThe `format` is a *string literal* consisting of the keys described below, where the space character between the keys are ignored. The `types` is the same format as used by `abi.decode`, and the number of types must match the number of \"captures\" provided in the `format`. Both of these rules are so an encoder/decoder can be generated at compile time.\r\n\r\nThese could be placed under `abi.`, some new namespace, or left top level.\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n```solidity\r\nbytes memory data = pack(\"i8 c20 A\", -1234, \"20 bytes of string!\\0\", this);\r\n(int64 a, string memory b, address c) = unpack(data, \"i8 c20 A\", (int64, string memory, address));\r\n```\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n| Key | C type         | Solidity type | Python | Ruby | Lua | Comments |\r\n|-----|----------------|---------------|--------|------|-----|-----|\r\n| t   | \"bool\"         | bool          | *      | *    | *   | (probably not needed)\r\n| b   | char           | int8          | Y      |      | Y   |\r\n| B   | unsigned char  | uint8         | Y      |      | Y   |\r\n| h   | short          | int16         | Y      |      | Y   |\r\n| H   | unsigned short | uint16        | Y      |      | Y   |\r\n| iN  | int            | intN          | *      |      | Y   |\r\n| IN  | unsigned int   | uintN         | *      |      | Y   |\r\n| l   | long           | int32         | Y      |      | Y   |\r\n| L   | unsigned long  | uint32        | Y      |      | Y   |\r\n| cN  | char[]         | bytes         | *      |      | Y   |\r\n| c0  | C-string       | string        | *      |      | Y   |\r\n| A   | char[20]       | address       | n/a    | n/a  | n/a |\r\n\r\nThere are two more special symbols:\r\n- `>` sets big-endian mode (this is the default)\r\n- `<` sets little-endian mode\r\n\r\nAdditional rules:\r\n- any number of spaces between the keys are ignored\r\n- a valid lowercase hex number (in the form of `[0-9a-z][0-9a-z]`) is taken as a literal value to be matched\r\n- the underscore followed by a decimal number (`_NN`) literal signals the number of bytes to skip (or zero-pad in case of packing)\r\n- `iN` and `IN` mean that `N` is a decimal number literal which defines the number of bytes of that integer type\r\n- `cN` means that `N` number of bytes are expected, where `N` is a literal decimal number\r\n- `c0` means that a zero terminated C-string is expected, furthermore it must be valid UTF-8\r\n\r\nOne of many questions: should the decoder fail (revert) if the length of input is shorter than expected? I think so, though one could argue if that is calldata then it can be \"safely\" zero padded.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nExample for decoding ABI encoded data:\r\n```solidity\r\n// Decodes 32-bit, skipping 12 bytes, and 20 characters.\r\n(uint32 selector, address recipient) = unpack(data, “L _12 A”, (uint32, address));\r\n```\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThis is only a rough draft and I think we have to be careful at selecting this initial list of supported keys. I think the above is a good starting point, but not something final. It could also eventually deprecate `abi.encodePacked`.",

    "body": "Thinking about this perhaps we should consider making the above compile-time fixed-size only. This means removing the `c0` key as that depends on the input.\r\n\r\nIf the expected length and the generated output length is known at compile time, then\r\n- the compiler can insert a length-check statement and revert if out of bounds,\r\n- it would help the SMT checker to at least argue about the input/output lengths,\r\n- it would simplify the generated code.\r\n\r\nI don't see any immediate use case which would need that dynamic behaviour, in fact I would expect the dynamic behaviour to be handled by the caller. Also note that Python, Ruby, and Lua, each to some extent support dynamic behaviour, some stretching it to provide a \"semi-regexp\" format. We absolutely want to avoid that here.\r\n\r\nShould also consider replacing `abi.encodePacked` with a specialised version called `concat`. Perhaps the difference is that smaller number of types are supported.\r\n\r\nSome example code follows:\r\n#### Eth2 deposit contract\r\nbefore:\r\n```solidity\r\n        bytes32 node = sha256(abi.encodePacked(\r\n            sha256(abi.encodePacked(pubkey_root, withdrawal_credentials)),\r\n            sha256(abi.encodePacked(amount, bytes24(0), signature_root))\r\n        ));\r\n```\r\nafter:\r\n```solidity\r\n        bytes32 node = sha256(pack(\"c32 c32\",\r\n            sha256(pack(\"c32 c32\", pubkey_root, withdrawal_credentials)),\r\n            sha256(pack(\"<I8 >c24 c32\", deposit_amount, bytes24(0), signature_root))\r\n        ));\r\n```\r\nNote due to support for endianness, there is no need for the [`to_little_endian_64` helper function](https://github.com/axic/eth2-deposit-contract/blob/r2/deposit_contract.sol#L165-L177).\r\n\r\nCould also choose to represent the padding as a literal, such as `<I8 0000..0000 c32` where the `00...` part is 48 nibbles long, but the above seems shorter.\r\n\r\n#### openzeppelin/ecdsa\r\nbefore:\r\n```solidity\r\n        // Check the signature length\r\n        if (signature.length != 65) {\r\n            revert(\"ECDSA: invalid signature length\");\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        // Divide the signature in r, s and v variables\r\n        bytes32 r;\r\n        bytes32 s;\r\n        uint8 v;\r\n\r\n        // ecrecover takes the signature parameters, and the only way to get them\r\n        // currently is to use assembly.\r\n        // solhint-disable-next-line no-inline-assembly\r\n        assembly {\r\n            r := mload(add(signature, 0x20))\r\n            s := mload(add(signature, 0x40))\r\n            v := byte(0, mload(add(signature, 0x60)))\r\n        }\r\n```\r\nafter:\r\n```solidity\r\n        (bytes32 r, bytes32 s, uint8 v) = unpack(signature, \"c32 c32 B\", (bytes32, bytes32, uint8));\r\n```\r\n",
