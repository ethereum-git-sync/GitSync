We'd like to have a simple, static HTML page listing all the binaries available in solc-bin.ethereum.org instead. The information should come from the `list.json` files.\r\n\r\nThe page should list all the details but for readability they should be folded by default. The page should still work without JavaScript though. At worst, everything should be unfolded without JS but it would be best to use a semantic tag like [`<details>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/pl/docs/Web/HTML/Element/details) to make it completely static.\r\n\r\nThe page should also contain the content of [README.md](https://github.com/ethereum/solc-bin/blob/gh-pages/README.md). We should also expand that file to include more information about the whole setup. In particular, what is the recommended URL to download them from and that they're also available via other means (Swarm, IPFS).",
