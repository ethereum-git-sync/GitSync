  "body": "Document source maps as described in https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/713\n## \n\nIt seems from my cursory investigation that `--combined-json=srcmap` could be useful for my purposes, but I'm having a hard time understanding the code that generates them (`CompilerStack::computeSourceMapping`) and I've found no documentation of the meaning of the `srcmap` strings.\n\nThey look like this:\n\n```\n0:63:1:-;;;15:46;32:10;:15;;:26;48:9;32:26;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;15:46;0:63;;;;;;\n```\n\nI've gathered that there's one `;` entry per assembly instruction. I think that the comma-separated fields are:\n1. source location start index\n2. source location length\n3. source file index\n4. instruction jump type\n\nAnd that these fields are \"compressed\" such that for the current entry, only the prefix of fields which are changed from the previous entry are printed.\n\nSome questions:\n1. What's the difference between `srcmap` and `srcmap-runtime`?\n2. Can I as a `solc` user know the order of source file indices?\n3. What is the significance of the instruction jump type?\n4. Is there an open source example of using the `srcmap` fields?\n\nThanks!\n",
