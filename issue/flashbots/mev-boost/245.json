The VC doesn't really have the full beacon state, so while it can compute a fairly accurate state, it may not know the accurate state of the validator key at a given point in time, and so it's a messy thing for it to first query the state of all of the keys it owns. \r\nThe BN is in a similar position for calculating duties that a VC considers active, sometimes it will get validators that aren't due to perform duties(unknown, exited, slashed etc) but they're gracefully handled and do not result in a failure of the request.",
