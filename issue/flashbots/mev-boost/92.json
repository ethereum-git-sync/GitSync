  "body": "As we move to a p2p relay network, we need a mechanism that ensure that relays and builders who are new or go offline for a period of time are able to catch up to the latest. With the `SetFeeRecipient` method, this can be achieved roughly by sending announcements at regular intervals. However, this creates a lot of unnecessary network traffic. It would be better if there was a _pull_ mechanism that a relay/builder could invoke when they wish to calculate the mapping. Here are a few ideas:\r\n\r\n* Fee recipient bulletin -- there could be a smart contract on mainnet that validators submit signed announcements to and builders could process all events from the contract to calculate the mapping. Since there is still no BLS primitive on mainnet, the mapping couldn't be authenticated on-chain. Thus, it is more of a bulletin.\r\n* Fee recipient DHT -- since the p2p network will likely already use `discv5`, we could use one of the extensions to store a mapping of validator to fee recipient. It's not clear how expensive it would be to iterate through this DHT, but at worst the relay/builder should be able to quickly get the proposers for the next epoch.\r\n* Fee recipient syncing -- as each announcement is signed, it would be possible to create a syncing strategy to acquire the mapping. It could be ranged over either validator indexes or unix time (e.g. \"get latest announcements for validators `n`...`m`\" or \"get all announcements from `n`...`m`).\r\n\r\nAre there other approaches? I'm leaning a bit towards the syncing strategy as it seems simplest and most robust of the above ideas.",

    "body": "This was discussed at the mev-boost workshop on mev.day, and the conclusion was that we'll use `builder_setFeeRecipient` (now called `builder_registerValidator`) for the sake of simplicity for all parties (including validators).\r\n\r\n* `builder_registerValidator` uses the payload from `prepare_beacon_proposer` (which needs an update to include timestamp, pubkey and signature)\r\n* validators usually send this call between each slot and every other epoch\r\n* mev-boost keeps resending it to the connected builders\r\n\r\nFuture approaches to mappings might be reconsidered in due time.\r\n\r\nClosing this issue for now. If there's something missing, please comment, and we can also reopen.",
